,"We just had the most wonderful experience at Curly Hair Designs. My daughter had an appointment today with the marvellous owner, Paula, and her fantastic apprentice, Ayesha.  I cannot express how thrilled we are with the results! We were shown such kindness and care and it truly made our day. The transformation of my daughter s curls is amazing, but it s the transformation in my daughter s confidence that I m most excited about. She LOVES her hair and feels so beautiful and it made me tear up to see her feeling so powerful and self-assured.  Paula really took the time to show us both how to help my daughter s curls get and stay hydrated and healthy. I ve struggled for years with a million different products and I finally feel like I have a system and tools to help my daughter, and I m just so grateful!. My only wish is that I had found Paula and Curly Hair Designs sooner. Thank you Paula and Ayesha for being so patient and for taking such care with my daughter and I.",Ayesha,transformation of my daughter s curls is amazing,shown such kindness and care,show us both how to help my daughter s curls get and stay hydrated and healthy,Paula and Ayesha were so patient and took such care with my daughter and I,,,,,

"great cut, and replicated the style I had in mind","Rhea was fantastic! Having not been to a hair stylist for quite awhile, I did lots of research to determine where I wanted to go and which stylist I wanted to see. I was not disappointed at all. Rhea answered all my questions, told me everything she was doing and all the products and techniques she was using so I could try to replicate the results myself at home. Its not quite been a week so well see how that goes. I love my new look (she gave me a great cut, and replicated the style I had in mind) and the fact that Im not tying up my hair or hiding it away.
