Ive been three times over 2 years. Once I went blue from natural, once I went a very light purple and silver from Manic Panic blue, and most recently I went full rainbow from a botched pink and purple Manic Panic split dye. The staff are always very kind and have never judged or commented on my home bleaches and dyes, unlike at some other places that have previously been rude about my tendancy to get bored and dye my own hair. No matter what I show up with in my hair they manage to make it work and get me close or to my hair goals, as well as helping my hair recover from the frequent bleaching. I am very happy with the quality of the hair dyes I get here The staff are also super friendly and accommodating. Most recently, my rainbow dye took 9.5 hours (including a short break partway through), and Lindsay was very kind and accommodating of my anxious little brain the whole time. I read a book for a while, played on my phone, chatted a bit, ordered a pizza, and fell asleep for a hot sec, and she was very chill and just kind of rolled with it. On a previous visit, I ran almost an hour and a half late due to a personal emergency. I fully expected to be told too bad, go home, but the stylist was amazing about it, still did my hair, and didnt even make me feel bad about it even thought I was very late and it was kind of rude of me to do so.

You should have a chance to talk to the stylist before the wash  it s not an assembly line.

A few days ago, I brought my daughter in to have her ends bleached, dyed pink, have her whole head washed, blow dried and straightened with a flat iron. I booked this appointment about three weeks in advance and was told it can be done. Unfortunately,  the quality of service was not how I remembered and left my daughter and I quite disappointed. Claudette had forgotten about the bleach and dye and washed my daughters hair right away, but quickly rectified this and got to the coloring once I reminded her. She trimmed my daughters hair and after bleaching it, didnt saturate the pink dye on the ends, so the colour was VERY faint and you could still see some of the orange from the bleach that didnt get any colour. Claudette didnt seem to have enough pink dye and was squeezing the last remnants of the dye out of her tube, but it was clearly not enough. Im not a hair dresser by any means, but I know that you need to SATURATE colour on hair to make sure you dont miss any spots and that the colour is vibrant. After the wash, Claudette blow dried, used 2 different hot combs AND a flat iron and my daughters hair was not flat straight. Half an hour later, her hair was already puffing up and frizzing. Later that day, I purchased my own Manic Panic pink hair dye and dyed my daughters ends so that the colour was vibrant and even and it turned out great because I saturated it. I also used a Remington flat iron (purchased years ago at Walmart) and achieved a flat straightened look that we should have gotten at the salon. This is when I noticed the horrible trim job that was done to my poor daughters hair! I was going to let the poor dye and straightening job go because I thought I at least paid for a good hair trim, but I stand corrected and this is why I felt like I needed to write this review. I have attached a photo I took of AFTER I dyed my daughters ends myself to even out and darken the pink and straightened it flat. You can clearly see her ends are extremely choppy and just horrible.

This was my first visit at this salon. The place does not look organized AT ALL. The funny part is, no mirrors to look at while the hair is being cut. I am not sure if the place was being renovated. But, you dont get the feeling of being in a salon at all. I dont remember my stylists name, a lady with burgundy dyed short hair. To begin with,the basin to lay your head on is not positioned properly. She kept pulling my head behind every minute . Usually, I look forward to the head wash as that is the most comforting feeling you get with someone else massaging but, here, I felt like running away without the wash itself. The hair cut was fine. What I got annoyed with was her rough use of hair brush on wet hair, pulling my hair apart. I personally dont like the use of flat iron and prefer a simple blow dry with the hair brush. However, I dont mind the flat iron if done gently. Once she began using the flat iron, each time she slid the flat iron, a bunch of hair would get trapped in it. The flat iron was damaged! I waited for 2-3 rounds to check if it was a one time thing. I stopped her immediately and asked if she could stop straightening the hair and just brush my hair instead. Her response:Sorry, I cant, I have pain in my palms.I would have bought that excuse if I didnt experience the rough use of her hands on my hair.

My stylist was Annslea. She is nice enough and a friend of mine (with fine/thin hair) had a great experience and a lovely cut done by her - but for me not so much. I have an undercut that needed to be cleaned up along with a haircut. I really don t believe that thick and course hair is her thing. She gave me serious razor burn on my neck when cleaning up my under cut and it just looked awful and was painful. I had a reference photo for my haircut as well and it looked nothing like it she didn t ask me many questions in regard to what I wanted so I figure the photo was enough. She cut my bangs and did not do any face framing which makes it look a little blocky she also did a straight cut on my thick hair which is a no no. On top of this, before even asking me - she started to curl my hair which was done so poorly that I went to the bathroom on my way out of the mall to add water to my hair and get it out. I looked better going into that salon than coming out of it. Needless to say, for the amount I paid I was really very disappointed and the look of it growing out is no better. I will be going elsewhere to get this cleaned up after I grow it a few more inches. Again, if you have fine hair - she s ok.

Shannons team are real creatives and were able to craft a style for each person who got their services. If you are considering booking her for a wedding, absolutely do. My advice to you when working with her for a wedding: - Book a bridal trial so you can test out what hair and makeup will look good on you. Shannon can bring your pinterest ideas to life, but also listen to her for her advice. - review your contract thoroughly. Shannon is super clear about her fees, rescheduling and incidentals. However, there is a lot of content and you want to make sure you understand what you are paying for - give lots of extra time for hair and makeup- we ran about an hour later than I originally anticipated, but this wasnt an issue because I put a lot of flex time into our day. - Shannon is a fantastic floral weaver.

Frankly we kept talking over one another because after being told my review was dishonest he wouldn t let me explain and just got upset with me for not handling it the same day. I took time to think about this and phrase it as nicely as I could, and then let them know about my review the same day, so to me that s not waiting, I left a review after I calmed down and didn t expect a refund. He didn t ask me what happened/to explain, he called and just started telling me I was wrong, I was wrong or lied about the fan and he would take me to wear he bought the fan  that s not appropriate as a business owner. I m sorry I m not the best at conflict, I ll get upset quickly, so I left a calm and composed review of what happened the following MORNING, not even 24 hours later. I ll be calling them to let them know I ve changed my mind, I don t want a refund or a gift certificate, I want people to know what could happen when they go. I told him that not everyone is going to have a good experience, that s all the happened here - August 11th, 2023 Update: I called to tell them i was leaving it up and was told he was calling a lawyer, so that s this business. Overall, not very impressed. I did 3 services and only was happy with 1: I enjoyed the facial, was very unhappy with the mani and pedi. Great price, not happy with the service. I would save your money or just go for the facial and literally do your nails at home. I went yesterday for a 10:30 appointment and left at 2 with my fingers still sticky and those were the first item done. They took over an hour only to leave with polish on my skin on left hand, my thumb with a big hole she tried to fix, bubbling on both middle and ring finger of my left hand. I was given a fan for my nails at the very end to try and dry the thumb she put her nail through and it was a regular fan that didnt dry anything despite sitting there for an extra 10 minutes after all three services. Everything used was things you could get from the store, a OPI base coat, color (that was expired or at minimum separated/old) and a top coat. No special light, nothing extra to make them long lasting or even chip less, it was the same as doing them at home.  Again they were done at the start and were still not dry over 3 hours later. This is a let down especially when I was getting these done for a wedding and I redid them a few hours later because they were that bad. My toes I liked at first when I saw them in the basement however she was rough at the cuticle and I mentioned when it hurt. I looked last night because its STILL sore on my right big toe and you can see theres dried blood... cause she cut my skin. Theres a gap where she cut me, I left with blue nail polish on the skin around my nails on both feet. None of the tools came out of new packaging nor where they cleaned in front of me, I wasnt given any sandals to get from the chair to the facial table so I had to walk on slippery cleaned, lotioned feet on a dirty ground and almost slipped a few times. No one mentioned that the person I would be with would be primarily French, I cant speak a lot of French and she couldnt speak a lot of English so we couldnt really communicate which isnt a problem but it would be nice to let someone know that. These services require communication and I couldnt ask anything, she couldnt/didnt explain anything... it was a very awkward and not a very comfortable to sit in silence for 3.5 hours and now Im stuck with toes I had to clean up, a toe I hope doesnt get an infection and I had to redo my nails because after being painted for 3 hours, I wasnt able to drive home with them without them being further messed up... Id like to add: I paid, I tipped and I didnt say anything when I left because I thought I was being too harsh and everything Ive looked at them its just been something else that looks bad or something else that was messed up and this morning I decided I wanted to leave a review. Service: Pedicure",13:19.5,"Usually when I respond back to a bad review I start with being sorry that the client wasnt too happy with the service. This is not the case this time because Kats review has nothing to do with reality. It is a dishonest , unfair, hateful and discrimination against my staff member just because she speaks French and a little bit of English. I called Kat and offered money back which she agreed on then she changed her mind and kept the reveiw . As a  business owner I always try my best to please  all my clients and it is very normal that you cant make every one happy . But this is not the case with Kat Martin.

ChIJkcOHx8UHzkwRTFwBC2s93Vs,Flawless Hair Salon - Ottawa Balayage Expert,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURqajZYWFN3EAE,1,"DO NOT GO TO FLAWLESS HAIR SALON OTTAWA If I could put ZERO I would! As a mom of 3 kids I m BUSY! And getting my haircut is not something that gets to happen as often as it should. It s definitely one of my favourite things. I get to relax and feel a little pampered for an hour or so. Well my experience at Flawless Hair Salon (which is just down Hunt Club) was awful! I visited Flawless Hair Salon and Spa in Ottawa on Sunday, April 28th. I was excited to get my hair cut since I haven t had it done since last Summer. Savvy and I had back to back appointments and we were trying a new place that I had found online that had good google reviews as my previous hair dresser had moved to another city. The appointment was supposed to start at 8:30am and the salon opened at 8:00am, so we arrived a little before 8:30 only to find no one was there. The doors were locked and when the hair stylist did arrive it was after 8:30. She wanted to wash Savvy s hair and mine one after another so I was sitting on the bench with wet hair while she cut Savvy s, didn t really feel relaxing, but I tried to just shrug it off. Then she cuts my daughter s hair and she keeps asking me if it s even I should have left at that point. Once she got to my hair I asked if she could thin it out some for the summer since it s thick and she said no because it would thin out on its own since I just had a baby. I tried to just trust her judgement but it felt like she just didn t want to take the time. She went on to cut my hair in a rush and didn t even finish fully blow drying it. I wasn t getting it styled since their salon charged extra for that and I was already tight on cash. In total Savvy s and my appointments together took 45 minutes. She didn t show me the back of my hair and made me feel incredibly rushed. My hair right away felt funny so when I got home I straightened it and sure enough she had not cut it evenly and Savvy s wasn t either. I was so disappointed! I emailed the salon through their site (couldn t attach photos) and the stylist called me back acting like nothing could be wrong and how she thought the appointment went great. She said she could see  IF  she had cut it uneven but because I didn t get a style they couldn t guarantee it would be even. I was shocked! I asked to speak to the manager and was told they were on vacation for the week but I could email again and they would answer. So I waited till Tuesday May 7th to reach out again because I heard nothing and was sent emails filled with frilly words to try and make me feel like they cared but being told they don t give refunds for services already preformed. They offered to fix it for free even though I had already gone elsewhere to have it fixed. (The first photo is how it looks now after Chatters fixed me up!) They also said they were putting a gift card on my account but didn t even specify how much. I was livid at this point because there is no way I d ever return there when they did such a poor job on both mine and my daughter s hair and wouldn t even take responsibility. So with all of that I decided I would name them on social media because I don t want this happening to anyone else! Getting your hair done is expensive but it s also supposed to be an enjoyable experience, not leaving you hating how you look. I gave them numerous chances to refund me but they refuse and I don t want anyone else having to go through this. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!",13:22.5,"Dear Rebekah, Thank you for sharing your feedback.

In the past, the staff was exceptionally professional and friendly. However, recently Ive noticed a decline in their overall service quality. The hair stylists work doesnt meet the standards Ive come to expect, and they seem to rush through appointments without giving enough attention to customers. Its concerning that my hair is being handled by multiple stylists during a single visit, as it affects the consistency of the result. I should add that the new receptionist, a young lady, has been quite unfriendly. Her attitude negatively impacts the customer experience.

Once I left the salon, my body started levitating and ever since then, I ve been flying around town. True story. My hairstylist, Kearn, is absolutely amazing and I will never, ever let him go!!! I showed up with a brassy, patchy hair looking to get an ombre, with dark roots and beautiful blond at the tips. Imagine a very cute worm politely requesting to become a butterfly. Yeah. Thankfully, Kearn accepted me as a client. He took time to go through my reference pictures before our appointment to understand exactly what I wanted. He also explained to me what to expect in terms of final result. It was important for me to manage my expectations due to the colour buildup left after the red hair phase I had last summer. Pro tip: GIRL, DO NOT DYE YOUR HAIR RED, ESPECIALLY AT HOME. After running things by equally talented and knowledgeable Kara, the co-owner of Glow Hair Studio, we came up with a plan that required me signing a waiver. One could say that both I and Kearn were taking a little bit of a risk that day and, oh my God, did it pay off! I got exactly what I wanted. Now I have the best hair in town and the rest of you will have to just deal with it Kearn is a perfectionist    Talented and knowledgeable professional, he is meticulous in everything he does. That being said, the five hours that we spent together were a real pleasure because of his natural charm and amazing sense of humour! He is really fun to chat with, but please, don t get carried away like I did at times: allow him to concentrate on working his magic! I could keep going or you could just take a look at my before/after pictures! To be fair, everybody seemed absolutely amazing. Kara assembled a great team. All the stylists and the support staff are extremely attentive and kind. Their slogan should be:  You are in good hands ! I will be recommending GHS to all my family and friends. Another pro tip: treat yourself to a glass of wine while getting your hair done, if that s your thing :) They have a nice selection of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.

And instead of refunding me for that portion of the services provided, they insisted on trying to fix it. Which then made the situation much worse. For reference I have very fine, easily damaged hair. I had asked for light brown highlights to compliment my natural tone.  Due to my fine hair and health issues, my hair cannot support multiple colourings. I then had to wait a year to get the colour corrected for a third time. Which they insisted Bruno would do himself, to ensure the service provided was correct and what I had asked for. I again asked for light brown highlights to match my natural tone. What I received  was all over dark mahogany with purple tones. I again requested a refund as I no longer trust the salon to touch my hair. I also have a wedding in a month, that I now have to damage my hair further to correct. I was told to wait; over an hour, to resolve the issue at the salon and then was also told they cannot process the refund for at least another week. This has been a huge waste of my time, my resources, and my emotional wellbeing. And it still isnt resolved. ******************************************* It has been over a month since Bruno Racine confirmed I would be getting a refund.

After asking over and over if it would be easier to get our curly hair cut washed instead of dry I had to absolutely insist my daughters hair was washed first so she didnt have to sit there and get her curly hair brushed out with a comb. My stylest kept dropping his comb and brush then continued to use them on me. Both of us have layered hair and I asked if they were going to cut more than just the bottom all around and neither of them did. I paid over 80$ for both of us to leave with our hair half uncut and needing to find a different place to get it fixed. I dont understand why they didnt trim all the hair but maybe they just werent used to doing layers in womens hair. I wish it would have been easier to get what I asked for because I mentioned my dead ends in my growing out bangs and nothing even happened to them. I would have refused to pay until it was fixed but my daughter is autistic and the confrontation would have made it worse than losing out on the money.,14:08.5,,,0,14,,TRUE

I wanted to offer our sincere apologies for what appears to have been a glitch on our business page on Google yesterday. We did verify the hours after you left and in fact our Friday hours were listed as Saturdays. This will require me to contact Google and hopefully they can fix this.

A phone call never hurts either to verify the businesses ability to accommodate your last minute needs. Just to shed some light on the situation and how our Salon operates (and how most salons operate) We work on appointments that we schedule within our hours of operation, some clients booking in months in advance. When we are able to accommodate a Walk In we are happy to do so, but this is a rarity as we mostly work on appointment. In regards to your comment that two employees doing nothing they were not stylists... as a business that works hard to maintain its reputation we employ support staff and students who are learning to do hair, NOT EVERY ONE IN A SALON IS A HAIRSTYLIST. Even if they were stylists they are allowed to take breaks... They were waiting for the two stylists who were cutting hair to finish so we could close the salon (at the expected time which was 5:00pm regardless of the glitch on google) and enjoy our lives outside of work.

I don t mean just in one spot it s splotchy, has dark spots, light spots in the wrong area, etc. I made sure to check their website and instagram and it s a joke. It s definitely not her work. On top of it I paid over $360 for my Colour without a cut!! Please be aware . There are amazing salons out there but unfortunately this is not one of them.",14:36.1,We are sorry to see by your reply that you were not satisfied with your service.

My stylist didn t give me cut I asked her to give me, I asked for lots of layers which should give me volume and she keeps on saying that volume you will only get with the products. I agreed to chop big chunk of my hair to have layers but she didn t do as asked and just chopped it and was done with my haircut in 20 mins and I was shocked. I usually go to Nathalie but this time I was in hurry so didn t get her appointment and i am very unhappy with my haircut. On top of that what I didn t like that when I was paying for my bill she was standing right there until I tipped her, which was very rude behavior and I felt like I am forced to tip her So overall i lost my hair length , didn t get my required haircut and volume but did get  disappointment for sure. ** EDITING MY RESPONE***** I am unable to reply to your unfair response on my review.

I rather had to wait and when I asked how long , I was told to wait 10 mins which I patiently did.  I am not sure what makes you say I was late or you are confusing me with someone else. Then I explained her that I wanted lots of layers to add volume to my hair. She then proceeded with cut - mind you I didn t ask her one time to rush and rather was surprised that she finished so quick in 20 mins. With half my hair length chopped, I confronted her that she didn t add layers like I asked and she responded that she can add now. I told her it would mean I won t have any length left and she said yes. I have had great service from other stylist here in past, so nothing against salon, just this experience. Also not expecting any discounts or complimentary service ( I don t have length left to have correction- need to grow it out before any further cut) but honestly pointing out why I was disappointed with service and then your response) Maybe take it positively and improve on it.",14:39.6,"Cherry we are sorry your experience was unpleasant this visit. In fairness you did show up for your appointment almost 15 minutes late which did reduce the time allotted for you, however you were still here for good 45 minutes. Your stylist-is a seasoned professional and did her best to accommodate you, even though you seemed to be rushing her from the beginning. It is also standard for our stylists to walk clients up to the front to ensure clients are happy, often further recommended products or rebooking. We are more than happy to offer you a complimentary fix if you would like to call the salon at your earliest convenience at 613-523 6594 and ask for Katherine or Dan:)",14:39.6,3,3,,FALSE

My goal was to get rid of my curly/wavy, thick and frizzy hair that was completly unmanagable. From the start Maria was very honest with me and told me that due to my hair type, the keratin treatment wouldn t make my hair 100% straight, but that it would definitly address some of my goals . In the pictures below you will see : 1) My hair at its curliest 2) My hair in its usual wavy / frizzy state 3) My hair after my first wash 4) My hair after a few minor corrections (done at home with a hair straightener) My hair truly feels brand new, its SO soft and so much more managable than before. Although their are spot where i still see frizz and a slight wave/curl, im still very happy by the results. It usually takes me 30-60 minutes to get my hair presentable to leave my house, now it takes 10. Thank you so much to Maria and the Precision Hairstyling team, i was so nervous for this treatment at first but the results speak for themselves. :) UPDATE: This treatment had a noticeable longevity of 6 months for me and my hair.",14:39.6,We are so happy you are loving the results!

ChIJxV9Wi7gFzkwRzPN5OyJnI2c,Hair on Second Avenue,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwczRTZnJBRRAB,1,"Summary: got my hair cut here last year, still dealing with the fallout and waiting for the damage done to grow out - literally the worst haircut I have ever gotten I debated writing this review for a long time because I didn t want to be negative, but I feel I have to say something, especially as I am still dealing with the consequences of coming to this salon. My appointment was around July of last year. I have thick, healthy, very slightly wavy hair, and I for an above the shoulders cut and for layers to add some movement. Keep in mind that I ve had layers done many times before, so I know what they are supposed to look like. I don t know exactly what happened, or why they would do this, but the stylist THINNED OUT my hair so much that   and I am not joking or exaggerating whatsoever   the ends curled up like those of a CARTOON CHARACTER S (think Olive Oil from Popeye). It was bizarre. My hair did this for MONTHS, no matter whether I let my hair airdry out of the shower or whether I tried to fight back with styling creams and a curling iron, in which case it would look better for maybe a day before reverting back. Whatever they did made it so that my hair REJECTED styling attempts, obviously the opposite of what I wanted. It has finally grown enough now that we have been able to trim some of this thinned hair out, although the stylist made sure to thin out the top as well, so I am still having problems. Another problem I am still dealing with is the FRIZZ. I have never had frizzy hair, nor any heat damage as I avoid using damaging styling techniques. I wanted to encourage waves and texture; instead, the excessive thinning means that I get to fight the frizz every time I wash my hair, or settle for hair that looks DAMAGED. For the record: I have experience with different hair textures as members of my family have hair that is much curlier than mine, so I know the problem is the cut, not my styling techniques. Like I said, things have improved because I have grown out some of the damage, but it will probably be another 6 months before I finally have my thick, healthy-looking hair back. I regret having to write this, but since the damage is ongoing I felt compelled to say something.",14:44.4,,,5,3,,FALSE

I was a client of hers years ago and always loved the amazing service she provided. However, in November 2023, I saw Susan as Alison wasn t available for color and a cut. Susan butchered my hair. The color wasn t too bad but the cut was awful. I have never cried over a bad cut or color but once I got into my car, I sobbed the entire drive home to Stittsville. On top of that, the bill came to $400! I left a generous tip of $55, which looking back, I should never have given. I understand the product prices have gone up however, to charge someone $350 for a root touch up, maybe 6 foils and a butcher job for a haircut is unacceptable. I m still seething and my hair is still recovering sadly. It s taking forever to grow back. I ve been wearing it tied back most days because I just can t do anything with it. I have since seen someone for a trim, just to even it out. It was an inch and a half longer on the left side.

It is also the first salon where I have never felt pressured to colour my (increasingly silver) hair or buy product. They always have great suggestions when asked, however, and I do buy their products because they are awesome quality and last a long time!

Im from out of town and dont know of any salons in the city. I visited this local salon specifically because I was looking for a hairstylist that understood how to cut Asian male hair, and Mai did not disappoint. Highly, highly recommend everyone to visit this salon. BOOKING: I called on a Friday afternoon looking for a same-day or next-day appointment. They were fairly busy and booked up for the weekend, but Mai did her best to accommodate, and she offered to cut my hair after hours (around 6:30 - 7PM, which is after their Friday closing time of 6PM), or I could take my chances the following morning and be on a waitlist. I was planning on just visiting during their Saturday hours, but happened to be free and in the area around 6:30PM, so I called to see if she was still available, which she happily agreed and told me to swing by. HAIRCUT: Before starting, Mai took the time to go through a style book and explained the differences in hair lengths for different styles, provided opinions on what she thought would look better, but also listened to my personal preferences and input before we agreed on a specific hairstyle. She was quick and efficient, and checked in throughout the appointment whether I still liked the lengths of certain parts, and whether any adjustments were needed. The haircut was exactly as advertised and what I was looking for. SERVICE: I cannot speak to the service of other hairstylists at this salon, but if theyre anything like Mai (the owner), then youll be provided with incredible customer service. She was very friendly and greeted me with a smile as soon as I walked in. If you have the chance, book your appointment with Mai. Shes very personable, loves meeting new clients from all walks of life, and was very easy to converse with during the appointment. She was attentive throughout the haircut and its clear hairstyling isnt just a job for her, but rather her passion. She treated me as if I was a regular and I could tell she really cared to give me a haircut that would make me feel and look my best! PRICE: Very reasonable pricing, and cheaper than most other salons around the city for the same services (~$30 for a haircut & wash vs. $35-40 for a haircut at other salons). OVERALL: It was the first time in 15+ years that Ive been to a hairdresser other than my usual one (since Im only visiting for a few months due to work but desperately needed a haircut), so I was a bit nervous going in. Mai put me at ease and provided spectacular service throughout the entire appointment. Visiting this salon completely changed my outlook on what a haircut appointment experience should be like, and has set a new standard for me. Its no surprise that clients from all over and out of town would make the journey just to have their haircut at Mai Mai.",14:57.4,,,0,7,,FALSE

He always made up for it when he made mistakes by giving me the cut for free if he really messed up, but after a while I would just be so nervous about what he was going to do that neither of us could relax. Anyway, the final time I went I had an appointment and he was running 25 min late so I asked if we were going to start soon because I had an appointment to get to after my cut. Rather than just letting me sit there waiting, the professional thing to do would be to apologize and let me know how long I would have to wait so I could decide whether or not I might want to go out and do some other chores, etc. He didn t apologize and simply told me that this was  the nature of the business  and then told me he wouldn t cut my hair any more because I was never happy and it stresses him out too much. I did my best to work with him and give him feedback during this whole time, and I frustrated that he treated me like this in the end. I think he is just taking on too many clients and he is burning himself out.

The owner emailed me after I posted my review to see what could be done to make my experience better. He then invited me to come in the next day (today) and he worked with me to give me a cut I liked. He shaped my hair while dry and wildly curly, washed then went over it again. The shaping he did really made a dofferdiff and I like the cut much more now. Its still very short but that can only be fixed with time. I felt so bad leaving the previous review but he didnt make me feel bad about it at all, told me I did the right thing. I will go back again. -------- I got a hair cut here yesterday and I hate it.

Went in the next day for my appointment - the girl did 3 Toners which did nothing but make my look worse and like a glow worm - the roots needed to be lightened before toning.

I didn t want to pay but she said she would call the police.

He said it would take up to 2 weeks to process a cheque - why can t I just go tomorrow and deal with it? According to him - since I work in law  why can t I wait and why do I need the money back.

Three times over the years I ve had hair dye services in which the last service has finally turned me to look for a new hair salon. My second hair dye I had asked for maroon red, and they had dyed my hair orange. When I asked them to redo it - you could tell they were frustrated but they did it. I went in for my first balayage on my third dye experience and last appointment I had wanted bright silver as my main colour to transition. Being blonde I was told by friends who had had this done by their stylists- that this should be relatively easy in comparison to darker hair. The stylist at the time with SAAB when I asked for this said  No - that simply won t suit your skin colour. It will blanch you. Better to have it as blonde especially as a first balayage. You ll look better with it.  Honestly I wasn t sure what to say as I had never had one done and she was the expert, but given the price I paid for the service and other hair dye services with similar experiences  I realized that I needed to find a new salon for myself. I mean don t get me wrong the balayage is beautiful but it s super light and barely noticeable even with proper care of cooler water and hair protection shampoos. I think this is also a lesson in standing up for what you want regardless on what the hairstylist says  but you should be in an establishment that supports your vision while still making suggestions and confirming with you. Again I won t diminish the whole place as it is excellent with their spa services  and they cut hair wonderfully  but unless you demand for what you want and are your own expert in hair colour and dye - I personally would look elsewhere for colouring.

When she had to cancel my appointment at the last minute for terrible, but understandable, circumstances, the salon was unable to provide any sort of accommodation that matched her experience. When I asked for other options, the manager personally insulted me and threatened me if I wrote a negative review because she was the manager. She seems inexperienced and defensive. I will not be giving LPS my money or business any more. Edit: The only response I have to the establishment s own response is that the owner kept on bringing up the personal situation of the hairstylist in question, presumably to make me feel bad for requesting accommodations that, as the owner notes, were fair of me to refuse. Honestly, it s all very shameful. I will not be giving this business any time or money. Having experienced a situation like my hairstylist and then having it basically weaponized against me was triggering and offensive. Shame on them.",15:50.0,"Hi P., Thank you for leaving such a stellar review. I would however, like to set the record straight. Like you mentioned, we had to cancel your upcoming appointment with Jessica due to understandable personal reasons which I will not delve into in this publicly-accessible reply to your review. Our receptionist then proceeded to offer you another option for the same day with a different stylist which you declined because it was not a stylist you would be open to see which is more than ok. We have stylists with different approaches to hairstyling as well as differing years of experience. The receptionist was unable to offer any other time on the day of your original appointment as all of our other stylists were back to back booked. Brenna then transferred your call to me because she was not able to find a solution that would sufficiently satisfy you. When I first got on the phone with you, you told me that our receptionist was unwilling to offer you any suitable solutions so I tried to help and see if there are any. I asked you if you would be open to coming in any other day. You said that you work in the office and cannot come in during the week - again this is understandable. You also could not come in next weekend because you were not available so I offered you a weekend appointment two weeks from now. You proceeded to tell me that you have an event next Saturday that you need to get your hair done for. Again, this is not a problem. Now, however, I was running out of options to help you find a replacement appointment - you cannot come during the week because you work, you have an event next Saturday for which you need to get your hair done, and you do not want to see the only stylist who has an opening this Saturday. Then you proceeded to ask me if you could receive a discount if you make an appointment with the junior stylist who has a space for you this Saturday to which I responded that the salon will, unfortunately, not be able to provide any sort of discount as the stylist s prices (which are significantly lower that our senior stylist s prices) already reflect the years of her experience. Another of your questions was that if a senior stylist could supervise the colour application to which I responded  no, they, unfortunately, could not  for two reasons. Firstly, because our junior stylist is more than capable of doing the job that is required of her and secondly, it would not be fair to the clients of our senior stylists for the stylist to step away from them to supervise your colour application. At this point, I am completely out of options for you. I did really try to make this work for you somehow, yet you were still unhappy with the outcome; and the manner you were speaking to me was unacceptable so, I am not afraid to say, I did say you WERE BEING unreasonable. You then used your  I will write a negative review about you  card to which I said I will respond appropriately. In conclusion, we offered all the possible options to you, none of which worked for you - fair. There is, however, only one thing that I will not tolerate and that is when you talk to my staff or me in an unacceptable and/or rude manner.",15:50.0,3,5,,FALSE

I had booked an appointment but apparently according to Dino I didn t go through the last step to finalize the appointment - whether this is true or not there is a nice way to approach a customer when saying this. Instead of being polite he proceeds to tell me that he pays 100s of dollars on a system that Costco pays millions for and it s flawless - newsflash buddy no technology is ever flawless we see it all the time so right when that comment was made it put me off to the guy and the whole business. I just needed a quick touch up of a haircut and if he didn t have time that s fine, but being nicer to your customers isn t that hard. I was coming from the other side of town and he wasn t willing to make any exceptions - he didn t seem to want to help anyways. I will be taking my business elsewhere.

You came in on a very busy day, the shop was full if  you noticed. I apologised to you multiple times even tho this was not my fault. So I don t know where the bad customer service claim comes from? Let me take your review as an opportunity to explain how it works, so someone ready your review can take advantage. Just like any other online booking system out there, when you place an online reservation you get an instant confirmation number that acts like a receipt to your booking. Without it your booking will not show in our system. it was not my intension to offend by any means; but how do you expect me to do a perm cut and style when I m fully booked already? Anyways I wish you best of luck at the new salon you chose to go to, I m sure they can do a good job too, and I hope you reconsider your review because of one small hick up, since you have been to the salon many times before.

She gave new life to my hair by resetting my expectations keeping my best interests in mind. Will keep returning. Even after 7 years of being with them, they are keeping up the same level of standards or even better. Way to go HR! Edit: I originally wrote the review 4 years ago. Fast forward to 2021, after so many lockdowns, I booked a balayage from another reputed salon (due to the long waitlist here) in the city only to end up with frizzy, cotton candy, over processed and highly bleached hair that put me to misery. I booked a Keratin treatment and blowdry with Hair Republic to fix the damage a little bit.. and Stylist Zach is nothing short of a magician. He quickly understood my issues, reassured me that my hair is salvageable and gave me the best possible hair treatment almost returning my hair to its former glory. Its Consultants like Zach that makes Hair Republic my go-to salon in the city. And I am never making the mistake of going anywhere else again. I had my best hair cut/balayage treatment with New Talent Stylist Laura Kardos! She was excellent in understanding me, setting my expectations and delivering the results as discussed, on time, with my complete satisfaction. She also has great personality that kept the 3 hours going in a relaxed, friendly atmosphere.

My hair has changed a lot in the last 3 years so I couldnt tell what would work, but Ying could.  (This is in contrast with other stylists over the last couple of years who left me with wings once I let my hair air dry).

I specifically asked for someone who has experience with curly hair and my hair still ended up looking like a staircase. I wanted a layered curly haircut and the cut was so bad that I cant even let my hair down anymore. I have to tie it all times or have to use million pins to set my hair. The hairdresser also didnt know how to style curly hair after the cut. She barely used any water while applying the hair products and my hair became super frizzy. They ended up charging  me 100$ for this atrocious haircut. They only good thing about my experience was the hairdresser who was very kind and polite. I dont recommend this place for any of my curly girlies.,16:08.1,"Hi Gurpreet, Thank you so much for taking the time to leave us your honest feedback on your past haircut appointment .

Balayage can be good for 6 months so I was open to that again (if it could be closer to my natural color) or other options. I was told I was given a demi permanent color that would match my natural color and slowly fade away over time. My 2 issues is that at the end of the appointment that I was told that this was a toner that will fade in a month and cost $100. Why would I be given something that would only last a month when I specified I wanted something long term? My second issue is that it did not match my natural hair color at all (which I guess it is good it will fade out in only a month!). At the salon it didnt look too dark and I figured it was just because any darkness was due to the old balayage being covered but as I got home I realize how stupid it looks. My hair is dark brown and my eyebrows are blonde....we had family photos taken the other day and my hair almost looks black in them. Really shouldnt have gone to the appointment at all. It was a waste of money and time, it took alot of planning and time to organize getting downtown for the appointment and I regret it. I will spend the next week washing my hair to try and get this out before starting over at another salon.",16:26.5,,,0,35,4,FALSE

I only wanted to have a two-inch trim and shaping of the back, with a scissor cut only.  I was sent Jamie for the haircut, and I repeated what I wanted with him before they started, and during the haircut.  They insisted that 2 inches trim was not enough, and I agreed to 4 inches taken off.  I was shocked to discover that my hair was actually cut 8 to 12 inches, and whole areas were cut and texturized.   They used a razor and thinner, when I only asked for scissors to be used, and there are large gaps or holes in my hair now.  My hairline in the back is 2-3 inches higher than before, again without my consent. I was very upset after my haircut, and when I very politely brought this to Melissa and Jamie (the specific stylist), I was not even offered an apology, explanation, or a refund. Moreover, Jamie claimed that he did everything I asked and denied any mistakes or wrongdoing of any kind.  Overall, the haircut and the service were very poor, and the response was hurtful, unprofessional, and lacking in empathy.

I heard great reviews about Alem from a lady I had met and I booked the FIRST appointment available at about 10:00AM. When I got there, someone was already seated and there were already about 4 different women at the salon waiting next. She didnt seat me until approaching 2PM. I decided to be patient because I didnt have anything scheduled that day. As soon as I got in the seat, Alem was immediately rushing my hair. I came to get almost balyage-like styled highlights and instead she just did regular bleached highlights that didnt compliment my skin tone at all and were extremely spaced out. After she washed out the bleach, she literally just slapped on leave in conditioner. No toning, treatment, nothing of the sort. It was my first professional hair dying experience so I didnt know what to expect, but after consulting with other stylists this experience was truly disrespectful. I was in such a state of shock by what happened and there were so many customers (I can tell they were her regulars) who were complimenting the work, I was too embarrassed to speak about how I really felt. I didnt want to write this review because I want to support my fellow black businesses and not tear anyone down, but I came to this salon with the best intentions. Im a student and I had wanted to treat myself, I spent my hard earned money on an experience where my feelings and time were just completely disregarded. Please do not pick favourites and feel as though you HAVE to serve your regulars who show up unannounced because you feel an obligation, over customers who took time out of their schedule to come and see you.

Would absolutely never go there again and wouldn t recommend to anyone. Went for a very straightforward hair cut here last week and 10/10 would NOT recommend. My hair is very long and I went to have it cut to collarbone length and donated. Sara, the stylist put my hair in pony tails that were below collarbone length because she said several times she wanted to make sure she didn t cut too short. Fast forward 30 minutes and I have a full on Mom Bob. My hair is a solid 3 inches shorter than I asked for, doesn t even touch my shoulders  oh, and this horrible Bob is incredibly CROOKED and completely different lengths on each side. Half way through the hair cut I said  I m worried you re giving me a Bob here  and my stylist said  oh no, no it s not a Bob, don t worry.  My reaction when the whole cut was done was that I have never felt so much like a mom  not a compliment. A very straightforward and very easy haircut that was done so badly/ not even a little what I asked for and then cost $97.",17:02.6,,,1,8,1,FALSE

ChIJzaDEqLAFzkwR8NH6eXFOAcw,Studio B,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURROGNuNkNREAE,1,"I had a terrible experience at Studio B in December. I made my first appointment with Amber to have some pink added to the tips of my hair and to touch up my red hair dye at the roots. I was originally booked for a consult with Amber, but the salon later called back and cancelled the consultation, saying that Amber understood what I wanted and I could just come to the appointment. I brought my colour info from my previous stylist (Im from out of town and was considering Studio B as my new salon), and said that I was looking for a demi-permanent for the red, which is what I am accustomed to having. I showed the info from my previous stylist to Amber and she said that my two options were semi-permanent (which would wash out in about 4 washings), or permanent colour. I asked what the price difference was, and she told me it would be $50, so I opted for the permanent colour. The entire appointment took a little over 5 hours (I have never had hair take that long, and Ive had some pretty complicated custom colour jobs in the past). In the entire time, Amber hardly said two words to me. I made several attempts to strike up a conversation with her, but they fell flat each time. Amber went out of her way to socialize with the other stylists, the other stylists clients, and even the delivery man. I understand that not every stylist enjoys talking through an entire colour job, but I would expect that she might have tried to get to know me as I was a potential new client. When she was finally able to wash the colour out of my hair, she scrubbed parts of my hairline raw trying to get the dye off my skin. I told her that it hurt and asked her to be more gentle, which she sort of did but continued scrubbing anyways. When she brought me back to her chair she suggested that she turn me away from the mirror so she could surprise me when it was dried. I suspected that this point that she actually did it because it was a bit of a hot mess, but I went along with it anyways. When she was finished, I must say, the colour is gorgeous. What I wouldnt notice until I got home (since I wear long bangs), was that there was dye from my hairline down to my eyebrows, and all the way down the back of my neck to my shoulders! All of this aside, my biggest beef was the price. The entire job cost more than double what I was expecting to pay, based on the pricing on the website. I paid and left, because I had already spent nearly 6 hours in the salon and needed to get home. When I got home, I discovered that the place along my hairline that Amber had scrubbed raw was actually bleeding (I had scabs all along my hairline for days following the appointment), and the dye on the back of my neck took days to wash off as well, forcing me to wear my hair down for days. In an attempt to make things right, I called the salon the next day and described my experience. They had Amber call me back and authorized a free treatment to make me happy, but I insisted that a partial refund was necessary, since I had no intention of coming back. She informed me that the price we arrived at was only $50 more than what we discussed at my consultation (the one she cancelled, which therefore, never happened). She then quickly back-peddled and suggested that there had been an email consult, which there never was (I only ever communicated with the salon by phone). We agreed upon an amount that would have us meeting halfway between what I thought I was paying that day, and what I ended up paying. However, when I went in to receive my refund, the owner nickel and dimed me on it, reducing the refund to nearly half what Amber had promised on the phone. The colour job is amazing, but Amber is a talented colourist and I am sure a more affordable colour job would have also looked amazing too. Essentially, I was upsold without being told the cost (and Im not sure I ever would have been given one, since there were a lot of extra charges thrown in, like $40 for a blow dry - what salon sends you out into the winter with wet hair from a fresh dye job???). Save your $$, go elsewhere",17:34.4,,,9,72,62,TRUE

This is what really happened. Your friend came in just wanting some pieces in the front, then changed her mind to getting a full balayage instead once in the Salon. She wanted to get a funky color (which is way more complicated), we did not want to say no to her because we know she came a long way to Ottawa, and we wanted to accommodate her. As a result, our stylist had to get somebody else to pick up their small children (5 and 7 years old) from their day care. Because she was so excited to get her hair done. Her hair was black long, and down to her waist, thick with no color. Her services were a Wash cut and blow-dry, full Balayage and a funky color toner, which should have been $500 but we only charged her $378 (which is a very good deal for what we had to do and for that amount of hair). She also ended up buying Kevin Murphy hair products (which is a very high-end brand), which she got in the big Litre sizes because she mentioned that where she was located there were no good hair products. Which workout to be nowhere near $800. In no shape or form did we take advantage of anyone as our prices (of services and products) are all on our website.

I booked with him on the day of a wedding I was going to, to have a trim and get some curls and body. I feel like he rushed through it because his next appointment was there and waiting and staring at us the entire time. He never asked me where my hair parts naturally and instead made a giant rats nest out of my roots. The wand he used wasnt hot at all and the curls fell straight within half an hour. I had to re-do everything in my hotel room. Terrible that I spent around $80 on that. The two friends I was with had beautiful styles from Taylor and Brittany and they made sure my friends actually liked the end result before dismissing them. It honestly seemed like he just wanted to get me over with and Im fairly certain he wasnt even pleased with his own work. So disappointing!",17:51.1,"I really appreciate your feedback, thank you for bringing it to my attention. I honestly wish I could turn back the clock and give you a different experience for your hair service. The customer service and standard of work should be a consistent and pleasant experience for every client.
