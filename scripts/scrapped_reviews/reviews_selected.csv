Curly Hair Designs,Pure awesomeness!!! Will return for sure!!! Rhea is excellent! My hair looks amazing,5,12:42.4
Curly Hair Designs,"We just had the most wonderful experience at Curly Hair Designs. My daughter had an appointment today with the marvellous owner, Paula, and her fantastic apprentice, Ayesha.  I cannot express how thrilled we are with the results! We were shown such kindness and care and it truly made our day. The transformation of my daughter s curls is amazing, but it s the transformation in my daughter s confidence that I m most excited about. She LOVES her hair and feels so beautiful and it made me tear up to see her feeling so powerful and self-assured.  Paula really took the time to show us both how to help my daughter s curls get and stay hydrated and healthy. I ve struggled for years with a million different products and I finally feel like I have a system and tools to help my daughter, and I m just so grateful!. My only wish is that I had found Paula and Curly Hair Designs sooner. Thank you Paula and Ayesha for being so patient and for taking such care with my daughter and I.",5,12:42.4
Curly Hair Designs,"I truly can t recommend this business enough. The work that Paula does in education and hair care during your appointment is incredible.

Curly Hair Designs,"Rhea was fantastic! Having not been to a hair stylist for quite awhile, I did lots of research to determine where I wanted to go and which stylist I wanted to see. I was not disappointed at all. Rhea answered all my questions, told me everything she was doing and all the products and techniques she was using so I could try to replicate the results myself at home. Its not quite been a week so well see how that goes. I love my new look (she gave me a great cut, and replicated the style I had in mind) and the fact that Im not tying up my hair or hiding it away. I feel inspired to continue going with my natural curls.",5,12:42.4
Curly Hair Designs,"Candice was incredibly attentive to my curls, and was clear about every step she was planning for my cut and style. Her encouragement and tips about maintaining my hair and battling my frizz will definitely get me to my next appointment!",5,12:42.4

Ive been getting my hair cut here for years and I have to echo other reviews raving about the knowledge and care that goes into every visit. My hair has never looked better, curlier, or healthier. I now understand my curls!! But the cherry on top is the styling that Rhea did for my wedding last weekend. She took so much care in setting each curl perfectly, and was even ahead of schedule! People could not stop complimenting my natural curls! And they held through a downpour of rain, photos, dancing, and even overnight. I woke up the next morning still looking perfect. I think Rhea might be magic!",5,12:42.9

She took the time to know my hair history, products being used ,treatments that have been done, wants & desires for moving forward with my hair as well. When I left I was more knowledgeable on product ingredients, managing my hair type & purchased some of their sold in store products. When I tell you I was instantly sold on this being my home salon after meeting the phenomenal stylist ,once I used their recommended hair products I have officially thrown out every other product I used to use.

Lucas Nault Hair Studio,"I had my first appointment here with Jessica yesterday! She is so talented and absolutely lovely to be around.

Lucas Nault Hair Studio,"I dye my hair at home quite a bit and go for some fun fashion colours, and when my hair gets too dead or a home dye goes wrong I go here for them to fix it. Ive been three times over 2 years. Once I went blue from natural, once I went a very light purple and silver from Manic Panic blue, and most recently I went full rainbow from a botched pink and purple Manic Panic split dye. The staff are always very kind and have never judged or commented on my home bleaches and dyes, unlike at some other places that have previously been rude about my tendancy to get bored and dye my own hair. No matter what I show up with in my hair they manage to make it work and get me close or to my hair goals, as well as helping my hair recover from the frequent bleaching. I am very happy with the quality of the hair dyes I get here The staff are also super friendly and accommodating. Most recently, my rainbow dye took 9.5 hours (including a short break partway through), and Lindsay was very kind and accommodating of my anxious little brain the whole time. I read a book for a while, played on my phone, chatted a bit, ordered a pizza, and fell asleep for a hot sec, and she was very chill and just kind of rolled with it. On a previous visit, I ran almost an hour and a half late due to a personal emergency. I fully expected to be told too bad, go home, but the stylist was amazing about it, still did my hair, and didnt even make me feel bad about it even thought I was very late and it was kind of rude of me to do so. Ive seen three different stylists here and have loved all of them, and I will be coming back here for my weird hair projects. I recommend this salon to everyone who asks about my hair, and huge shoutout to Lindsay for my most recent project.",5,12:45.2
Lucas Nault Hair Studio,Jess is amazing. I immediately felt at ease and comfortable with her (I was new to Ottawa last year) and see her every 2 months. She always listens to my requests regarding cut and color and gives me a superb cut for my bangs and unruly wavy thick hair. I walk out feeling fantastic every single time. It is truly a great experience chatting with Jess. The studio is an amazing space as well. Highly recommend this studio and Jess.,5,12:45.2
Lucas Nault Hair Studio,"Thankful for this safe 3rd place. Had a consultation and cut with Jessica, briefly explained my sensory issues and didn t have to explain further during the cut. As someone on the spectrum I didn t rly need to voice that for her to accommodate - so that had me very relieved. But felt comfortable if I needed to. Btw the Ricardo s special was amazing Requested style: Scissor cut",5,12:45.3
Lucas Nault Hair Studio,,5,12:45.3
Lucas Nault Hair Studio,I just got my hair dyed here the other day and I had a great experience! Jessica went above and beyond with what I wanted. She did way better than what I had imagined my hair would look like. I love it so much and will definitely be back! Also I am deaf and she knew to face me and gesture especially when I had my hearing aids off throughout the process so I found it less stressful with communication. I would consider this place deaf friendly as well!,5,12:45.3
Lucas Nault Hair Studio,Jessica did an amazing job highlighting my hair. Highly recommend!,5,12:45.3
Lucas Nault Hair Studio,"I made an appointment with Angelo B. He is simply incredible! I had horrible color (Bicoleur) during the weekend (I used drugstore color). Angelo put my hair in the right direction. Thank you again Angelo, great job and excellent service",5,12:45.3
Lucas Nault Hair Studio,"Lucas is such a professional stylist.  He asked me my needs: a professional looking cut, with bangs, short, but long enough to pullback into a ponytail.  And I dont do blowdriers. The cut was beautiful, to the point I got tonnes of compliments and it was easy to maintain.  I literally brushed it every morning and left the house. The added bonus is they use eco and biological products, which you can also purchase. The only hesitation I have with giving it such a great review is that others will find out about this place, and it wont be as easy to get appointments.",5,12:45.3
Lucas Nault Hair Studio,A recent haircut by Jess has me very happy.   She is a professional and a fun person.   Thanks for a great haircut!  Highly recommended.,5,12:45.8

Lucas Nault Hair Studio,,5,12:45.9
Lucas Nault Hair Studio,"I got my hair done tonight by Jessica and LOVE it! From the moment I stepped foot in to the salon, I felt so comfortable and relaxed. Jessica put so much effort into my appointment and we connected right away. She provided me with valuable feedback, education, and we really worked as a team to get the right cut for me! I had some pretty wicked hair damage due to a recent medical change and she really helped me love my hair again. I felt pretty hopeless prior to tonight. Thank you thank you thank you!!! Aside from the amazing stylist, the salon itself makes you feel comfy and right at home it s literally so awesome ! And great email communication too:)",5,12:45.9
Lucas Nault Hair Studio,"I was a regular (so far as someone who only got their hair trimmed twice a year can be called a regular) at Lucas Nault Hair Studio pre-Covid and was always happy with my visit. Having spent a chunk of Covid entertaining myself and my students by using wash-out bright colour hair dyes, more than one person had told me I should consider using more permanent colours so in December, I did. I booked a consult with Jess first (my first time with her as my stylist) and felt comfortable right off the bat. The day we spent together (my hair was a long process) was fantastic. Jess is AMAZING and Lucas was also on hand to help. I couldnt be happier with my colours of the wind hair. I love it and so do the strangers who stop me to ask about it. Best place to go for your hair and for a most relaxed and fun experience.",5,12:45.9

Lucas Nault Hair Studio,"Amazing hair salon. On Friday August 18th I brought my daughter and my niece to get our hair done. My daughter had Jess which was 100% fantastic with her, kept her hair a surprise and my daughter couldnt stop chatting up a storm with her which normally shes very shy, my niece had Rachel which Ive had her before and she explained the process to her and let her chose what color she wanted for her highlights. I had Quinn which she was amazing to. All staff there is amazingly nice and we all had fun and laughs! Next appointment is my husbands appointment with Jess and cant wait! 100% if you want to feel like you are at home, enjoy the company of the staff I would highly suggest you come here",5,12:47.1

Lucas Nault Hair Studio,"Absolutely amazing experience, Angelo was able to finally give me the haircut I have been looking for. As somebody who s really inexperienced when it comes to haircuts I felt super comfortable with Angelo and he seemed to understand what I was saying despite me not knowing a thing about hair. Plus he likes Weezer so I d give 6 stars if the app would let me",5,12:47.1
Lucas Nault Hair Studio,"I got my hair done with Jess and had a 10/10 experience!! She took the time to explain the process and pricing to make sure I was comfortable and didn t want me to leave until I absolutely loved my hair.

The pricing is very affordable and reasonable, I highly recommend to anyone looking for a new salon and I definitely will be going back!! :)",5,12:47.1
Lucas Nault Hair Studio,"Jessica is absolutely amazing!  Not only is she so professional, warm, welcoming (and funny) -she s an incredible hairdresser!  She understands my hair and has totally improved it.  I get so many compliments now.  The whole family now goes to Jessica!",5,12:47.7
Lucas Nault Hair Studio,"My hair was a mess. I had been to 2 different salons and both of them had ruined my color by failing to match my roots to my lengths, and then trying repeatedly without success to correct it. My hair was probably 4 different colors and levels by the time they were through. Jess squeezed me in for a correction and did a phenomenal job. She knew exactly what to do without further damaging my already tired hair. I left with hair thats a beautiful colour as well as softer and smoother. While she was working on me, I saw a lot of other people come and go, and all of them left looking amazing. I dont think you could go wrong with any of the stylists here. My new home salon.",5,12:47.7

Basically, 3 or so short layers, lots of volume - shortest layer is around the top of my ear Ill post my before and after cut. This is my second time getting a haircut, and each time, she delivers! It even works when I blow my hair straight too (: Also, I plan to get highlights in my hair for the first time ever.

If there was a Michelin guide for haircuts, Michael would be given a Michelin 3 star, simply without a doubt.

Last year I went to A-One Hair Salon, although I paid much more than 10 bucks but this time after coming home my wife said as long as I look like this she will keep loving me.

The employees are friendly and I could perceive a familiar environment. The place is clean and pretty. They make their beat effort, cutting, washing and rinsing your hair for a very affordable price. :).",5,12:53.6
A-One Hair Salon,"They treat the store like their house. They gossiped in Mandarin about customers and it was a very uncomfortable experience to sit through and remember. My hairdresser was polite overall but did not even pause once to ask if I was okay with what he was doing. My hair ended up 3 inches shorter than desired... It is insane how much he can just act like he was listening to me when I was explaining what I wanted. He also gave me side bangs I didnt even ask for... And he just said it looks pretty on me. My fiances haircut was done in less than 20 minutes with many uneven patches and then he was showed back to the waiting area. During the cut, my fiance even asked for it a little shorter but his hairdresser shut him down by insulting his taste. A girl that day seem to not like the result of her hair color but her stylist just complimented how pretty she looked and said the color was great. Basically. THREE DIFFERENT hairdressers on the SAME DAY showed willing ignorance to their customers wishes about THEIR hair. And then tried to cover it up with flattery and distractions. My friend who went there last year had a very uneven balayage. I thought I was safe if I was just getting a cut, but they cant do that right either. I will only recommend you to stay far away from this place.",1,12:53.6
A-One Hair Salon,They were very rude to me... I would never come back again.,1,12:53.6
A-One Hair Salon,"Poor customer service, employees are very rude and would openly insult you in chinese. They are also racist by literally telling a customer and I quote We close our blinds just so we dont have to serve white people. It doesnt end there... The place is a hazard with no one sweeping the floors and the place filled with hair combined with sharp scissors its just a lawsuit waiting to happen. Conclusion? This place is all looks and held up by their regulars that are willing to pay an overpriced haircut that you could get much cheaper elsewhere.",1,12:53.6

Before doing anything, though, I am offered a hot or cold beverage as soon as I walk in, and before Natalie does anything with my hair, we have a conversation about what I want/need. I am most likely her most difficult client because I do not like change, but Natalie is patient with me, each and every time. Shes the best stylist, and I consider her a friend!",5,12:56.0
THS The Hair Salon,I have been seeing Natalie for my hair cuts and colour for a few years and have always been pleased. I have thinner hair so my goal is to try to gain volume from the way the stylist cuts. Natalie will always start with a consultaion. I feel that she really cares about how the last cut felt as it grew out so that she knows what to do the same or different for the next cut. I find the quality of the colour to last very well and hold its shine right through until the next visit.,5,12:56.0

Richmond Hair Studio,"I m so dissatisfied with my haircut. I ve had long layered hair for years and hadn t had it cut in almost 2 years because of covid, so it should have been pretty simple to just update the same haircut. But I received a weird two-level  layer  cut with one layer much shorter, and everyone can see the layer line  it looks like two haircuts stuck together. I felt the stylist didn t take the time to properly do the cut, didn t check to make sure it was consistent, and also one of the assistants washed my hair before the stylist saw it so she had no idea what the beginning point was. You should have a chance to talk to the stylist before the wash  it s not an assembly line. I went back to have it fixed a few days later but she really was only able to soften the error, and it can t be fixed until my hair grows more. Also, it didn t feel covid safe  both times I got there one of the workers had their mask either off or around their nose. Two stars because they are nice and offered to fix it. But I can t recommend this place.",2,12:59.7

Richmond Hair Studio,"Nice place but i overall had a bad experience. I did not get the haircut i asked for and the girl who did my hair was very fake and kept making rude comments about the condition of my hair. I was not going to write a review before but recently i was walking by and they had an entire family inside without masks on during business hours, which is incredibly unsafe and irresponsible. Very disappointed, i will not be returning.",1,12:59.7
Richmond Hair Studio,"The atmosphere was lovely, I had a nice time while I was there, unfortunately I also received one of the worst haircuts I ve had in my entire life. Extremely choppy layers with one side of my head being more layered than the other side. I ended up going elsewhere to get it fixed but sadly they had to cut another 2 inches off my hair to do so. I won t be going back.",2,12:59.7

Claudette's Coiffure & Boutique Inc,"I got silk press done on my natural hair, and it was amazing. However, my appointment was delayed, and I was there for 4 hours instead of 2. Plus, I felt I overcharged! Paid $140 because she thought my hair was alot. The most Ive paid for that service is $100 plus a tip!",4,13:01.6
Claudette's Coiffure & Boutique Inc,"Let me start off by saying that I have gone to Claudettes salon when I was younger (many years ago) to get my own hair done and have been satisfied with the service, which is why I have given my review the 1 star. A few days ago, I brought my daughter in to have her ends bleached, dyed pink, have her whole head washed, blow dried and straightened with a flat iron. I booked this appointment about three weeks in advance and was told it can be done. Unfortunately,  the quality of service was not how I remembered and left my daughter and I quite disappointed. Claudette had forgotten about the bleach and dye and washed my daughters hair right away, but quickly rectified this and got to the coloring once I reminded her. She trimmed my daughters hair and after bleaching it, didnt saturate the pink dye on the ends, so the colour was VERY faint and you could still see some of the orange from the bleach that didnt get any colour. Claudette didnt seem to have enough pink dye and was squeezing the last remnants of the dye out of her tube, but it was clearly not enough. Im not a hair dresser by any means, but I know that you need to SATURATE colour on hair to make sure you dont miss any spots and that the colour is vibrant. After the wash, Claudette blow dried, used 2 different hot combs AND a flat iron and my daughters hair was not flat straight. Half an hour later, her hair was already puffing up and frizzing. Later that day, I purchased my own Manic Panic pink hair dye and dyed my daughters ends so that the colour was vibrant and even and it turned out great because I saturated it. I also used a Remington flat iron (purchased years ago at Walmart) and achieved a flat straightened look that we should have gotten at the salon. This is when I noticed the horrible trim job that was done to my poor daughters hair! I was going to let the poor dye and straightening job go because I thought I at least paid for a good hair trim, but I stand corrected and this is why I felt like I needed to write this review. I have attached a photo I took of AFTER I dyed my daughters ends myself to even out and darken the pink and straightened it flat. You can clearly see her ends are extremely choppy and just horrible. I essentially paid $200+ tip for nothing because I had to re-do everything myself (re-dye, re-straighten and re-trim). Everything I had gone it for, I did myself! I wont be a repeat customer and do not recommend this salon.",1,13:01.6
Claudette's Coiffure & Boutique Inc,"Claudette is a phenomenal hair dresser. My family, friends and I have been coming to her for years and she s amazing at what she does! She s very sweet and makes your time at the salon fun and enjoyable.",5,13:01.6

May 2022 (I KNOW too long between haircuts but between COVID and power outages enough said  ): I entered with blonde/white (colour from last visit blended evenly with new hair growth) Curls? no curls, because hair tied back  a la working from home, looking older than my 25++yrs  and a  Shave my head  attitude I left with a short, curly, soft bob-cut; looking and feeling FABULOUS. No colour added! My cut enables the true colour to shine, naturally. I appreciate Claudette and her  extended family  (AKA: Employees/Stylists) I can honestly say that they ve NEVER tried to talk me INTO buying a service/products that I don t need.

Claudette's Coiffure & Boutique Inc,"I bought the groupon hairwash,hair cut and style voucher. This was my first visit at this salon. The place does not look organized AT ALL. The funny part is, no mirrors to look at while the hair is being cut. I am not sure if the place was being renovated. But, you dont get the feeling of being in a salon at all. I dont remember my stylists name, a lady with burgundy dyed short hair. To begin with,the basin to lay your head on is not positioned properly. She kept pulling my head behind every minute . Usually, I look forward to the head wash as that is the most comforting feeling you get with someone else massaging but, here, I felt like running away without the wash itself. The hair cut was fine. What I got annoyed with was her rough use of hair brush on wet hair, pulling my hair apart. I personally dont like the use of flat iron and prefer a simple blow dry with the hair brush. However, I dont mind the flat iron if done gently. Once she began using the flat iron, each time she slid the flat iron, a bunch of hair would get trapped in it. The flat iron was damaged! I waited for 2-3 rounds to check if it was a one time thing. I stopped her immediately and asked if she could stop straightening the hair and just brush my hair instead. Her response:Sorry, I cant, I have pain in my palms.I would have bought that excuse if I didnt experience the rough use of her hands on my hair. What I disliked about the place was LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE and no interest in building customers. Id rather spend double money than getting cheap service. Not coming back again.",1,13:03.3

To be honest it was just a trim, but she was knowledgeable and friendly. I can t imagine her being rude. I paid extra with Groupon because I have shoulder length hair which is reasonable.

Saco Hair Ottawa,"It took me a while to finally leave this review because I gave the benefit of the doubt and hoped it would be better after a couple months of growing out .but I have to say something.. My stylist was Annslea. She is nice enough and a friend of mine (with fine/thin hair) had a great experience and a lovely cut done by her - but for me not so much. I have an undercut that needed to be cleaned up along with a haircut. I really don t believe that thick and course hair is her thing. She gave me serious razor burn on my neck when cleaning up my under cut and it just looked awful and was painful. I had a reference photo for my haircut as well and it looked nothing like it she didn t ask me many questions in regard to what I wanted so I figure the photo was enough. She cut my bangs and did not do any face framing which makes it look a little blocky she also did a straight cut on my thick hair which is a no no. On top of this, before even asking me - she started to curl my hair which was done so poorly that I went to the bathroom on my way out of the mall to add water to my hair and get it out. I looked better going into that salon than coming out of it. Needless to say, for the amount I paid I was really very disappointed and the look of it growing out is no better. I will be going elsewhere to get this cleaned up after I grow it a few more inches. Again, if you have fine hair - she s ok. Thick or course hair, do your research but I m sure another stylist at the same salon is more experienced with it.",2,13:04.4

LITTLE bit off the top and I was left with half an inch on top... worst part is she tried telling me no no it looks good, dont care, its not what I wanted.

Shannon Doyle was incredible, going through a long list of products and helping me pick the right ones that would make my bridal beauty dreams come true! I am really impressed with how they were able to accommodate using all my own products and brushes, and my hair and makeup turned out incredible both in person and in pictures and lasted perfectly through a long day of happy tears, rain, dancing and sweat.

Very informative especially since my makeup abilities are very limited. If anything needed to change, she was very accommodating to make the schedule work. I didnt have Shannon herself as our makeup artist, but Neelam was fabulous! She was able to do the bride, 3 bridesmaids, mother of the bride and two little flower girls. She stayed right on schedule. We all looked beautiful, while still having a natural look. I was the first up at 7am, and my makeup didnt budge, still looked great at 2am even while on the dance floor busting a move. If you need bridal makeup, be sure to reach out to Shannon!",5,13:13.7

Shannon Doyle Beauty,Shannon is the best! You cannot go wrong booking with her. Shannon did my hair and makeup as well as my bridesmaids for my wedding in 2022. We all looked amazing and both hair and makeup lasted all night. Shannon will jump through hoops to make sure everything is perfect for you. I would definitely book again and would definitely recommend.,5,13:13.7
Shannon Doyle Beauty,"Shannon clearly has a lot of talent with hair and makeup. I had many compliments on my hair throughout the wedding day, and she was very easy to communicate with leading up to the event. She even gave me a little bride kit complete with little odds and ends I might need throughout the day/evening. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5, is that I feel the goal of styling all 5 of us, plus doing my makeup was perhaps too lofty for the morning of. My hair was rushed at the end (but still looked beautiful) and the majority of the flowers fell out after about an hour. Some transparency prior about the practicality of styling five women total, and doing my makeup would have gone a long way into making the get ready experience less stressful.",4,13:13.7
Shannon Doyle Beauty,"I ve been meaning to email you my thanks since [my daughter s] wedding to share that your efforts in getting everyone ready and feeling beautiful were much appreciated! Specifically, your help in getting me (my shawl) and [daughter] ready, touch-ups, etc. were deeply appreciated given the chaos around us! You re a pro, doing this all the time. For us, it was a once in a lifetime event. You took away the stress of the day with your calm and low key demeanour. Really going above and beyond.  And, for that, I thank you. With sincere gratitude,",5,13:14.2
Shannon Doyle Beauty,"Shannon is great! Shes personable and very professional. I brought some photos of what I was wanting for my hair and makeup and she worked with me to combine my favourite aspects of each look. The day of my wedding was the first day of Stage 3. Shannon kept tabs on all the regulations and updated me about the safety protocols and services she could provide.  The best part, my hair and makeup lasted throughout my outdoor wedding in 42 plus degrees, with the humidex, weather. I look back at the photos of my wedding and truly love the way I look. Edit: I just used Shannon Doyles services for a large event. The fact that Im a returning client says everything. Amazing job; she went above and beyond.",5,13:14.2
Shannon Doyle Beauty,"Shannon, Amber and Kendra were incredibly talented artists who made my bridesmaids, mother and mother and I feel absolutely pampered. Shannons team are real creatives and were able to craft a style for each person who got their services. If you are considering booking her for a wedding, absolutely do. My advice to you when working with her for a wedding: - Book a bridal trial so you can test out what hair and makeup will look good on you. Shannon can bring your pinterest ideas to life, but also listen to her for her advice. - review your contract thoroughly. Shannon is super clear about her fees, rescheduling and incidentals. However, there is a lot of content and you want to make sure you understand what you are paying for - give lots of extra time for hair and makeup- we ran about an hour later than I originally anticipated, but this wasnt an issue because I put a lot of flex time into our day. - Shannon is a fantastic floral weaver. She made an outstanding floral design for me. Every flower stayed secure all night - BUY THE LIPSTICK. Shell pick a great colour for you, and its great peace of mind to know you can touch up anytime. Services: Bridal makeup , Wedding hair & make-up",5,13:14.2
Shannon Doyle Beauty,"Shannon was amazing from the beginning to the end. She had  great suggestions at my trial appointment for changes to make to my skincare routine for my makeup to be flawless on the day. On the big day, Shannon and Amber were on time, friendly, fun and crazy talented. All the very different hair and makeup looks my family members requested were executed beautifully and lasted all day and night. My Hollywood waves were a vintage wonder as Shannon was ready to do as much battle with my hair as required to make it perfect! I could not recommend their services more. Thank you so much again!",5,13:14.2
Shannon Doyle Beauty,Shannon did such an awesome job on hair and makeup for my daughters wedding last weekend. The three of us felt absolutely beautiful and Shannon is so much fun to work with.It was an incredible experience.  Highly recommend her and her team to anyone.,5,13:14.2
Shannon Doyle Beauty,"It was such a joy to have Shannon and her team do our hair and makeup for my wedding! Shannon, Neelam and Melissa came to our hotel to do hair and makeup for our 4 person bridal party the morning of the wedding and did an absolutely incredible job!  Melissa and Neelam both  were great about taking each persons personal style and preferences into account when creating hair and makeup looks for each person. Shannon was hilarious and definitely put me at ease during the whole glam process, and I felt absolutely beautiful. She was able to use a reference photo and change it a little to suit my hair type and colour, and created a makeup look that looked natural on camera, with a little touch of glam. Everything managed to stay in place all day and night, even through a bit of unexpected rain! I cannot recommend Shannon and her team enough!",5,13:14.2
Shannon Doyle Beauty,"Amber from Shannons team did a wonderful job on my hair and makeup for my wedding! I was especially thrilled with my hair   not only did she take my general ideas and turn them into an elegant and creative style, but it stayed in place all day (no small feat for my silky, stick-straight hair). Amber and Shannon were both so positive and great to work with   thank you so much!",5,13:14.2
Shannon Doyle Beauty,"Shannon and Melissa provided myself and my bridal party with their services a month ago for my wedding. Since first interacting with Shannon, I knew she would be the right the fit for me and the perfect person to work with! She set up a trial appointment a couple of months before the wedding and got a good feel for what I had envisioned for my wedding day. Once the day arrived, Shannon and Melissa travelled to the venue to get us all ready. The mood was relaxed and they both really helped to contribute to the low-stress and chill vibe we were all in dire need of! Everything ran on schedule and it was really just the perfect morning into afternoon that I could have imagined for my wedding day. Not to mention that it had to have been one of the hottest spring days ever... The makeup Shannon used held up fantastically through the elements. Melissa has a unique talent of bringing pictures to life and even though I never knew exactly what I wanted, I was able to show her stock photos of what I liked and she pulled it off not only for myself but for every member of my bridal party. My wedding day will be a day I will never forget and that goes with many thanks to Shannon and Melissa!",5,13:14.2
Shannon Doyle Beauty,"It was an absolute pleasure getting my wedding hair & make up done with Shannon and Melissa. Despite not fully knowing what I wanted, they were able to deliver the best look based on just a few pictures and description. I am still in disbelief how beautiful they made me look and feel!",5,13:14.2
Shannon Doyle Beauty,I cannot recommend Shannon enough - She and Amber created beautiful looks not only for myself but also my entire bridal party.

Shannon Doyle Beauty,"Shannon was the makeup artist for my wedding in October 2021, and she was incredible. She created unique wedding day looks for myself, my bridesmaids, my mom and my mother-in-law, and highlighted everyones natural beauty and features. Everyone looked stunning and we got so many compliments. The makeup lasted all night, even with all the dancing at the reception. Aside from the makeup, she was incredibly professional and a fantastic communicator. Our wedding was delayed because of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the reschedule process was incredibly straightforward, which was a relief given what a stressful time it was. I cannot recommend Shannon enough, it was an absolute pleasure having her be a part of my big day.",5,13:14.9
Shannon Doyle Beauty,"Shannon and her colleague Melissa did an outstanding job getting my friends and me ready for my wedding. The whole process was seamless from start to finish and the final results were gorgeous. All the ladies looked incredible and my hair and makeup were exactly how I wanted it. Shannon was great to work with leading up to the big day and gave us useful guidance on how to prepare. She diligently followed all required covid protocols so everyone felt safe and comfortable. Overall, working with Shannon was a great experience!",5,13:14.9
Shannon Doyle Beauty,"This is the second time I ve had the pleasure of working with Shannon. Last July she styled my hair for my friends wedding. It was the first time I had a wedding updo that not only held, but that I absolutely loved. Naturally when it was my turn to walk down the aisle I knew I needed her expertise once more. Shannon single handedly made not only myself feel like an absolute star but my mother, mother in law and two bridesmaids as well! Shannon took the time to consult with each of us to determine our desired looks and effortlessly transformed us. My hair and makeup held through all of the tears, hugs and dancing. I would highly recommend using Shannon for any and all special events! Thank you Shannon for all of your expertise and for making me feel so beautiful on my wedding day! You re truly one of a kind!",5,13:14.9
Shannon Doyle Beauty,"Shannon was amazing! Let s start with her awesome personality! She instantly makes you feel comfortable and calms any nervousness you may have. She s funny, informative ( I learned so much) and caring. My hair was beautifully done in beach waves. Those beach waves not only lasted all day and night, but the next morning I still was able to rock my hairdo! The makeup and products she used to face prep were all amazing. I wanted a natural, but flaw free look and that s what I got. I haven t felt this pretty in a really long time! She even give you a cute little to go bag with a little lipstick, and other awesome things to have for the day and night. My makeup never moved. I didn t even have to touch up my lips! I found my forever makeup and hair set Angel! Thanks Shannon! Can t wait to be able to do this again! I enjoyed our chats and belly laughs! Tanya",5,13:14.9
Shannon Doyle Beauty,Shannon is very talented. She did my hair and makeup for my wedding (August 2021) and I totally loved it.

Thank you Shannon! :),5,13:14.9
Shannon Doyle Beauty,"I recently used Shannon Doyle Beautys services for my wedding, for both myself and 12 additional ladies, and all I can say is WOW! Not only is Shannon and her team professional, but they are very personable and made our getting ready experience so much fun! A few months leading up the wedding Shannon had provided her recommendation of a skin care routine, which cleared up my skin beautifully. She provided a reasonable get ready schedule and kept to that time and even finished earlier than anticipated. She made the entire process easy and stress free! The makeup process was great and she nailed my bride look perfectly! My makeup lasted all night and into the morning, which was awesome. I only required one lip touch up throughout the event. I highly recommend Shannon and her team for any and all events!! A huge thank you again to you all, you did a fantastic job!!",5,13:14.9
Shannon Doyle Beauty,"Shannon was the hair and makeup artist for a wedding that I was a bridesmaid for.

Of course, I was thrilled with my hair and makeup   which lasted the entire day (on a hot September day). Thanks so much, Shannon.",5,13:14.9

From our very first phone call, to the perfect hair and make-up, everything about working with Shannon was amazing. We immediately clicked over the phone during the telephone consultation. She was funny, personable and really listened! I booked a trial and was so happy with the outcome. She had some really good ideas, and her products are great quality. The day of my reception she arrived on time and in great spirits, despite not feeling well. It really demonstrated her reliability and professionalism, and she blew me away with the finished look. My hair and make-up lasted all night and I really appreciated the bag of touch up supplies and other must have items for my clutch. Shannon is a true professional, she is extremely talented and I would highly recommend her to brides looking for the convenience of a mobile artist.",5,13:15.5

Tony And Chris Hair Studio,My first experience with a hair stylist for over 10 years. I came over to Canada and found the hard way that some stylist can t cut hair! So after many visits and lengthy stays I gave up and did it myself. I changed my mind the other day when I was having a migraine while doing my hair and I looked online and I saw all the flashy salons. They looks great but I know they will spend an hour and be like ok it s done! Ha nope! I read Chris reviews and her customers are from years. This is returning customers who are happy with their hair. This told me everything I needed to know and I booked an appointment. She spent the time on the hair that was needed. I was there for I think 2 1/2 hours. Maybe alittle more. I was over the moon. She is amazing and I have found my hair stylist. Her prices are amazing. She is amazing. The shop is very clean.

Hair World Salon & Spa,"Update: 3 weeks later the owner called me to tell me that this was a dishonest and unfair review, it was not. Frankly we kept talking over one another because after being told my review was dishonest he wouldn t let me explain and just got upset with me for not handling it the same day. I took time to think about this and phrase it as nicely as I could, and then let them know about my review the same day, so to me that s not waiting, I left a review after I calmed down and didn t expect a refund. He didn t ask me what happened/to explain, he called and just started telling me I was wrong, I was wrong or lied about the fan and he would take me to wear he bought the fan  that s not appropriate as a business owner. I m sorry I m not the best at conflict, I ll get upset quickly, so I left a calm and composed review of what happened the following MORNING, not even 24 hours later. I ll be calling them to let them know I ve changed my mind, I don t want a refund or a gift certificate, I want people to know what could happen when they go. I told him that not everyone is going to have a good experience, that s all the happened here - August 11th, 2023 Update: I called to tell them i was leaving it up and was told he was calling a lawyer, so that s this business. Overall, not very impressed. I did 3 services and only was happy with 1: I enjoyed the facial, was very unhappy with the mani and pedi. Great price, not happy with the service. I would save your money or just go for the facial and literally do your nails at home. I went yesterday for a 10:30 appointment and left at 2 with my fingers still sticky and those were the first item done. They took over an hour only to leave with polish on my skin on left hand, my thumb with a big hole she tried to fix, bubbling on both middle and ring finger of my left hand. I was given a fan for my nails at the very end to try and dry the thumb she put her nail through and it was a regular fan that didnt dry anything despite sitting there for an extra 10 minutes after all three services. Everything used was things you could get from the store, a OPI base coat, color (that was expired or at minimum separated/old) and a top coat. No special light, nothing extra to make them long lasting or even chip less, it was the same as doing them at home.  Again they were done at the start and were still not dry over 3 hours later. This is a let down especially when I was getting these done for a wedding and I redid them a few hours later because they were that bad. My toes I liked at first when I saw them in the basement however she was rough at the cuticle and I mentioned when it hurt. I looked last night because its STILL sore on my right big toe and you can see theres dried blood... cause she cut my skin. Theres a gap where she cut me, I left with blue nail polish on the skin around my nails on both feet. None of the tools came out of new packaging nor where they cleaned in front of me, I wasnt given any sandals to get from the chair to the facial table so I had to walk on slippery cleaned, lotioned feet on a dirty ground and almost slipped a few times. No one mentioned that the person I would be with would be primarily French, I cant speak a lot of French and she couldnt speak a lot of English so we couldnt really communicate which isnt a problem but it would be nice to let someone know that. These services require communication and I couldnt ask anything, she couldnt/didnt explain anything... it was a very awkward and not a very comfortable to sit in silence for 3.5 hours and now Im stuck with toes I had to clean up, a toe I hope doesnt get an infection and I had to redo my nails because after being painted for 3 hours, I wasnt able to drive home with them without them being further messed up... Id like to add: I paid, I tipped and I didnt say anything when I left because I thought I was being too harsh and everything Ive looked at them its just been something else that looks bad or something else that was messed up and this morning I decided I wanted to leave a review.

Flawless Hair Salon - Ottawa Balayage Expert,"DO NOT GO TO FLAWLESS HAIR SALON OTTAWA If I could put ZERO I would! As a mom of 3 kids I m BUSY! And getting my haircut is not something that gets to happen as often as it should. It s definitely one of my favourite things. I get to relax and feel a little pampered for an hour or so. Well my experience at Flawless Hair Salon (which is just down Hunt Club) was awful! I visited Flawless Hair Salon and Spa in Ottawa on Sunday, April 28th. I was excited to get my hair cut since I haven t had it done since last Summer. Savvy and I had back to back appointments and we were trying a new place that I had found online that had good google reviews as my previous hair dresser had moved to another city. The appointment was supposed to start at 8:30am and the salon opened at 8:00am, so we arrived a little before 8:30 only to find no one was there. The doors were locked and when the hair stylist did arrive it was after 8:30. She wanted to wash Savvy s hair and mine one after another so I was sitting on the bench with wet hair while she cut Savvy s, didn t really feel relaxing, but I tried to just shrug it off. Then she cuts my daughter s hair and she keeps asking me if it s even I should have left at that point. Once she got to my hair I asked if she could thin it out some for the summer since it s thick and she said no because it would thin out on its own since I just had a baby. I tried to just trust her judgement but it felt like she just didn t want to take the time. She went on to cut my hair in a rush and didn t even finish fully blow drying it. I wasn t getting it styled since their salon charged extra for that and I was already tight on cash. In total Savvy s and my appointments together took 45 minutes. She didn t show me the back of my hair and made me feel incredibly rushed. My hair right away felt funny so when I got home I straightened it and sure enough she had not cut it evenly and Savvy s wasn t either. I was so disappointed! I emailed the salon through their site (couldn t attach photos) and the stylist called me back acting like nothing could be wrong and how she thought the appointment went great. She said she could see  IF  she had cut it uneven but because I didn t get a style they couldn t guarantee it would be even. I was shocked! I asked to speak to the manager and was told they were on vacation for the week but I could email again and they would answer. So I waited till Tuesday May 7th to reach out again because I heard nothing and was sent emails filled with frilly words to try and make me feel like they cared but being told they don t give refunds for services already preformed. They offered to fix it for free even though I had already gone elsewhere to have it fixed. (The first photo is how it looks now after Chatters fixed me up!) They also said they were putting a gift card on my account but didn t even specify how much. I was livid at this point because there is no way I d ever return there when they did such a poor job on both mine and my daughter s hair and wouldn t even take responsibility. So with all of that I decided I would name them on social media because I don t want this happening to anyone else! Getting your hair done is expensive but it s also supposed to be an enjoyable experience, not leaving you hating how you look. I gave them numerous chances to refund me but they refuse and I don t want anyone else having to go through this. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!",1,13:22.5

Francesco Hairstylist & Barber,"Ive been a loyal customer at this barber shop for 5 years, mainly because of my fantastic barber, Tony. Hes friendly, professional, and skilled at any hairstyle I request. I highly recommend him for anyone looking for a great haircut. The shop itself is clean with amenities like a shower area and a comfortable waiting area with plush seats. However, the atmosphere can feel tense at times, and there seems to be some friction among the employees. Overall, while Tonys services are top-notch, the shops environment could be more welcoming. Stylist: My Stylist s name is Tony, he s the only I go to, he s very friendly and professional, he knows what he s doing and can do any type of hairstyles.",4,13:24.2

Francesco Hairstylist & Barber,Absolutely terrible experience! Did exactly the opposite of what I asked for. Never had a bad experience with any other barbers but Francesco as in the name is absolutely terrible. I asked for my bangs beyond my eyebrow to be cut off. He proceeds to cut all my bangs off. I asked for some more of the side 20 minutes before closing time and he just rejects it and says we re closing when in fact they actually close at 6:30. He cares more about the money than the clients. Any other barber there is fine. $0 tip given.,1,13:24.2

From the moment I sat in his chair, he took the time to understand exactly what I was looking for and provided valuable suggestions based on his extensive knowledge. His precision and technique throughout the haircut were remarkable, resulting in a hairstyle that perfectly matched my vision. Not only is Ahmed incredibly talented, but he also creates a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. He made me feel comfortable and engaged in conversation, which made the whole experience enjoyable. Its evident that he genuinely cares about his clients and takes pride in his work. The barbershop itself is clean, well-maintained, and exudes a trendy yet relaxed vibe.

Mint Hair Studio,I went in for a consultation and ended up having a heart to heart with Kristen.

I have curly hair and I was asked what I wanted, if I was okay with certain products or tools, and how I have been caring for my hair. I have never before left a salon with a cut or colour I like, until now. Quinn, youre a magician! Ill definitely be back!",5,13:32.9
Mint Hair Studio,"Not really getting all the rave reviews on here. The place is tiny and looks like it could use some work, but overall it is nice enough. The staff was polite but a bit cold. I got some moody vibes from the staff for sure. Same with the stylist. She was very rough washing and brushing my very delicate fine hair, and the hairdryer she used was sooo hot I saw steam coming off my hair which is NOT healthy for it. The haircut was nice but basic, not worth the $80 I spent to have 2 inches cut off in a straight line. They charge more for long hair which doesnt make much sense to me-  a trim is a trim regardless of how long your hair is! I am fine spending this much if the experience is very positive overall, but it was just so-so for me.",3,13:32.9
Mint Hair Studio,Last week I had my first visit to Mint and my stylist was Onneka. After years of trying new salons I have finally found a friendly and affordable place with a true artist.

Precision Styling & Il Paradiso Spa,"Excellent Salon. JS has been doing my hair colour for about 8 years and I recently needed a change. I showed him some photos and he was 100% honest with me and explained why they wouldn t work with my current colour and condition of my hair. Together we came up with a different plan and I m SO happy I took his advice. I was platinum blond with 8 months of DARK regrowth, which would be challenging for any colourist, but he did an amazing job and I love it more than I thought I would!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!",5,13:37.7
Precision Styling & Il Paradiso Spa,I have done Keratin treatment with Sevda last week. I wanted to wait for a week before I write a review to see the results after I wash my hair. She did a great job with my hair. I have a lot of hair and it took 5 hours to complete the treatment but it is actually worth the time and the money. I am so satisfied. Savda is very talented with hair blowing and ironing. I felt that from the treatment. She was taking small sections of my hair and making sure she applies heat and product on all of my hair. My hair looks stunning now,5,13:37.7
Precision Styling & Il Paradiso Spa,"For some unknown reason, I had two really bad experience getting my hair colour treated before I went to see Becky at Precision Styling.  She was able to correct the terrible job the other two hairstylists had done and to find the right formula for my hair.  Shes very professional and friendly.  She does such a good job that its always hard to find a time slot in her busy schedule, but its worth it!  JS has been doing my 84yo moms hair and shes very happy with his work, because hes very patient, kind and most importantly, he listens to his customers in trying to undestand exactly what they want.  All staff Ive met in this hair salon is very friendly and helpful.",5,13:37.7

Precision Styling & Il Paradiso Spa,"Ive been a customer of this salon for years. In the past, the staff was exceptionally professional and friendly. However, recently Ive noticed a decline in their overall service quality. The hair stylists work doesnt meet the standards Ive come to expect, and they seem to rush through appointments without giving enough attention to customers. Its concerning that my hair is being handled by multiple stylists during a single visit, as it affects the consistency of the result. I should add that the new receptionist, a young lady, has been quite unfriendly. Her attitude negatively impacts the customer experience. Regrettably, I believe its time for me to start exploring other salons!",1,13:37.7

Precision Styling & Il Paradiso Spa,My wife purchased some tanning sessions here via Groupon. I get that the price was reduced on Groupon (but that s the purpose of Groupon) so it was sad to see the age of the tanning beds as well as all of the layers of dust caught up in the fan of the vertical bed and above the machine. Would definitely avoid.,1,13:39.0

Precision Styling & Il Paradiso Spa,"Booked an appointment online for my husband on Vagaro app with JS. He is regular customer there with JS. But this time before Christmas when we went there they said our appointment is with Maria P!! We showed them proof of our text and email confirmation with JS! And they said they don t see it in the system! Are you kidding me people? Why use application when you don t have proper online booking system and don t know how use technology!!! No one even apologized for confusion And simply told us JS is busy with another client! It was right before Christmas and we were going out of town so without any option we decided go with this ls another hair stylist! And we showed her pic also with my husband s hairstyle that JS does all the time! And man she ruined it! Do you know how to use even scissors?? It was uneven on top and even after telling her which number we use for trimmer, she used different number for trimmer! She totally messed up! And that too right before Christmas! We felt like it was intentional! After that no one gave any discount! No apologies! Nothing! We felt like we are ignored and they are being partial to us! That JS didn t even look at us! Never going back there! You just lost your loyal customer!",1,13:39.0

She started off long and worked her way to shorter, and although I asked her to start over again three times because I kept deciding that i wanted it even shorter, she was very patient. I really liked that she went with the safe bet first by keeping it long and going shorter from there. The end result was a really great haircut that I love and she really took her time with it and made sure it was perfect. My next haircut will definitely be with her. Thanks Sumi!! :)",5,13:39.5

I cant believe my good fortune in having found this beautiful cozy salon.   Chantal and staff will have you feeling comfortable as soon as you walk in the door.  I visited Painted on Friday for a hair cut after a long holiday.  As always Chantal performed her magic with my fine thin hair.  Her warm and friendly personality will have you feeling at home.

Painted Hair co.,"Chantal is the best. I went to see her when my blonde hair was in really rough shape. I had went to another hairdresser that ruined my hair, and Chantal reassured me she can help me get that beautiful blonde hair back and that it would be a process. She fixed the bands that I had in my hair, and gave my hair life again. It is way less damaged now, and 3 appointments later, over the last 5 months and it s so beautiful! I was so embarrassed about my hair when I first went there and she  was so understanding and promised me we could get it back to looking good. She is so patient and amazing at what she does. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Very welcoming, beautifully decorated and just makes you feel at home. Thank you so much Chantal for your time, and I m so grateful to have you as my hairdresser :)",5,13:40.7

Ombel Salon,"I went for a wash/cut/style with Maryam today. Best hair salon experience ever! I have 2C hair and never learned what styles were flattering or how to keep it healthy and Maryam helped me so much! She listened to what I wanted (V/layers/face framing) and offered suggestions on how to alter it for my hair style. She kept me informed of what she was doing all the way through and often asked if I liked the feel and look of my hair and if not she fixed it immediately. I can confidently say that it s the happiest I ve felt about a haircut so far. On an other note, I ve always been wary of going to salons because of social anxiety but Ombel had a very welcoming and accommodating atmosphere, from the reception to the hair stylists.

Ombel Salon,"Ive been to this salon twice; both for a keratin treatment. First time back in 2022, I had no issues. This time, I found my stylist to be a bit distracted and continuously going over to another stylists chair to help her with her client. Consequently, I have a few sections of my hair that are still quite curly (and I dont have very curly hair). I also was also very uncomfortable with how she spoke to the other stylist and with the two younger staff recording tik toks right behind me. It just felt a bit unprofessional for the amount they charge.",3,13:43.5

It was my first time coming there since my usual place was unavailable and they were able to squeeze me in on the same day due to a cancelation. All the ladies were super friendly, they offered complimentary tea/coffee/cappuccino with a ferrero rocher as we waited and really took the time to understand my hair vision. The lighting in the salon made the hue look different from how it was in the sun and it wasnt for me. They called the next day to see how I felt about it and I came back the day and they made it perfect. They specialize in blonde hair and Id definitely recommend them to anyone looking for highlights or balayage.",5,13:45.3
Shampoo Hair Salon,"I have been getting my hair done by Danny for almost 30 years now, he s a true professional. His cuts are amazing, my hair always grow back nicely. I also love his colors and blow dry. He s truly a master hairstylist.",5,13:45.8

Shampoo Hair Salon,"This salon is truly amazing, Danny is very skilled at doing my hair, highly recommended.",5,13:45.8
Shampoo Hair Salon,"I got to the salon 10 minutes late but had called them earlier and they said it was okay. However, the stylist was still busy and seemed upset I was late. Even if I had been on time, I wouldve had to wait because my 10:30 appointment couldnt start yet. I asked how long the wait might be, but the stylist wasnt clear, so I didnt know when Id get my haircut. Because of this confusion, I decided to leave. Better communication about when appointments will actually start would really help.",1,13:45.8
Shampoo Hair Salon,So glad I found this little hidden gem in Ottawa! Danny understands which haircut goes best with your face and I walked out of the salon looking 10 years younger than when I came in. Worth every star!!,5,13:45.8

Unfortunately, Ive had to do an at-home temporary fix and book at another salon to get the look I wanted. Salon is beautiful and Dannys very nice, but it just wasnt the end product I wanted at all.",3,13:47.0

Not many stylist know how to use a single blade to cut and thin out my hair in a way that it lightly shapes my face. I was so happy he was able to cut my hair the way I ve wanted for years. Danny also did my bridal hair and takes such great care of me - there s no way I would go elsewhere. Thank you Danny for your many years of world-renown expertise and opening a Salon here in Ottawa.

Talking about the wash and shampoo- her head massage was fantastic!! Fariba did an OUTSTANDING JOB with my hair   she is truly a professional! I have curly long hair, she gave me an excellent haircut appropriate to my face shape. She gave me a blow dry, made sure the haircut and styling was done perfectly. She offered me tips on how to take care of my hair and most importantly seemed genuine not wanting to sell me anything that wasn t good for me like other places sometimes do. She offered me products that would suit my hair type which I appreciate. I walked out of the salon feeling like a diva!

Faribas professionalism and friendliness immediately put me at ease, and her attention to detail was truly commendable. One thing that stood out to me was Faribas willingness to listen to my concerns about my hair. She took the time to understand exactly what I was looking for and provided invaluable advice and useful tricks to help me achieve the look I wanted. Her expertise and passion for her craft were evident throughout the entire session. Since getting my haircut by Fariba, my hair has never looked better. Its healthier, shinier, and more manageable than ever before, all thanks to her skillful hands. But its not just about the haircut Fariba goes above and beyond by giving the most incredible head massages during the shampoo. Its such a relaxing and enjoyable experience that I always look forward to. I have to admit, Im not usually one to enjoy getting my haircut, but with Fariba, its a different story.

DeLuca Hair,"Updated to remove 1 star because I noticed my hair was uneven when I came home. Had to touch it up myself. Kind of disappointing. Friendly hair salon. The hairdresser was a bit too chatty but I think it s their way of building rapport. I liked my cut.. but the styling was a bit overboard with the excessive spraying. Note, only street parking available.",3,13:48.7
DeLuca Hair,"BAD EXPERIENCE- AVOID greedy people here. Stylist FARIBA, pressured a Senior family member  for a tip, after she actually did not listen to the kind of hair trim he asked for. He asked for a  Razor buzz  on sides of his head. She took out scissor and cut fuzz off the sides of bald head and then asked for $45!  He was shocked as a razor trim is $20-$25. Then when gave her a 50$ bill, expecting change -she said,  you really want change?.  Duh, after not listening and in fact doing a bad job. I Reported to Owner RONNIE , that Seniors, who wander in should be advised  of prices before service, and not given some different service than they asked for,  or   DONT WANT, but Ronnie only argued with me, said  it didnt happen , and did not apologize.  He said   Our Prices are good, and Ronnie outright lied by tell me  she never said -you want change   What HORRIBLE PEOPLE to treat paying customers so badly !",1,13:49.3

DeLuca Hair,"Went for a haircut with the owner himself. Had I known that his health is not  at its greatest, I would have booked  with someone else or even at at different  Salon. He gave me a haircut that I  never had in my entire life, life someone put a bowl on my head and cut the hair around it. The hair colour  was done by a young woman. At 10 AM, her breath was emanating strong marijuana smell. That was awful to have to smell that! Anyway, she coloured my hair in a colour that was not what I expected. before the colouring process started, I showed her the colour I expected.  I got a very bright colour, not natural, that I had to re-colour at home after paying big $$$. I would not recommend this salon. It is run by the  hairdressers who can do whatever. The owner is happy to be surrounded by young females and he would tolerate anything.",1,13:49.9
DeLuca Hair,Shane is amazing! I always love how he cuts and colours my hair. He listens to what you re looking for and makes you feel so relaxed during your appointment. Always a 5 star experience! So happy to have found an amazing stylist like him.,5,13:49.9

Everyone..me included..says the colour is just perfect...and the style is the best ever! Thanks a million Ronnie and Jennifer!  Lenore..client for over 20 years,5,13:49.9
DeLuca Hair,The owner is rude and makes people uncomfortable. Will not return.,1,13:49.9
DeLuca Hair,I just moved near the area into apartment and was looking for salon I could use going forward. They were not very inviting as they treated me as if I was a one and done. This attitude showed and I guess they were right because I would not go back. The haircut was not even good and it cost $45 for a simple haircut. First Choice Haircutters is even better for 33% less the cost. I am sure they treat people they see as potential regulars better but NEVER go here if looking just for a simple cut.,2,13:49.9
DeLuca Hair,Fariba is exceptional.,5,13:49.9
DeLuca Hair,Fariba is the most skilled hairstylist I know. She has been doing my hair forever and I would recommend her to anyone.

I had been to four other salons in recent years (in Westboro and downtown), getting one disappointing haircut after another.  My hair is thick and wavy and can be challenging to cut and style. Fariba corrected the problems from my last cut, and gave my hair shape and style that is easy to maintain at home. She took the time to listen to my concerns and preferences, and to explain her approach.  She is by far the best stylist I have had in many years. As an added bonus, she is also a very nice person. I highly recommend Fariba and DeLuca Hair.",5,13:50.5

DeLuca Hair,I just started going there 3 months ago (3 times now) and have already encouraged everyone to switch. Jennifer and the team are very professional and super efficient. It used to take my previous hairstylist 3.5 hours to color and cut my hair and I am at DeLuca for only 2 hours and the end result is much better.

Marina Hair and Beauty Salon,Thank you Raya for being so sweet! I had protein treatment and the result was phenomenal. I would definitely be back :),5,13:52.9
Marina Hair and Beauty Salon,"Dani does an amazing job. I was really skeptical about getting a blonde money piece, but the stylists knew which colours to go with and how thick it should be. He also does the best blowouts. Probably the only salon I ve been to where the hair does not get frizzy, and the style holds nicely for long periods of time. His prices are also fair. Highly recommend.",5,13:52.9

Their service and the treatment both impressed me. If youre looking to improve your hair, give them a visit!",5,13:52.9
Marina Hair and Beauty Salon,First time having the protein hair treatment by Raya. I asked all the questions and got realistic answers and it was true to the results. My hair was dried out from constant colouring and with the treatment the texture and shine are back. I had to get a full hair colour redo as the treatment changed my hair colour and I had to get it fixed the next day. Recommend it as I no longer blow dry my hair it just dries perfect and needs minimal care now.,5,13:52.9
Marina Hair and Beauty Salon,Love love loved the result of my hair after getting protein done at Marina!  Workers there are amazing and such sweet hearts! Enjoyed the end result and the company of my stylist Raya shes amazing!,5,13:52.9

Amazing service and fair price as always Dani",5,13:53.5
Marina Hair and Beauty Salon,I would not recommend this hair salon for anyone with curly or thick hair. I went here to dye my hair a lighter colour and came out with overly bleached and damaged hair for the next year+. Good customer service but I am afraid the outcome did not meet my standards of honesty and hair protection.,2,13:53.5

Marina Hair and Beauty Salon,Great salon,5,13:54.1
Marina Hair and Beauty Salon,"Stay away from this salon if you have puffy hair Hani will be sure to make you feel unwelcome. Went to get my hair trimmed and blow dried. I let hani know prior to getting my hair washed that I have puffy and curly hair. Upon getting my hair washed he had a freak out and kept exclaiming that it was too much, he would have to charge me more and kept yelling the word  Afro . In other words he came off as a racist and refused to do my hair unless I charged more. He did a lovely job making me feel unwelcome and out of place and made a point to make me feel discriminated against. If I could rate him in the negatives I would. No customer of yours, regardless of the skin color or hair type should be made to feel the way I did today. You said you didn t pay attention to reviews so I seriously hope this one catches your attention.",1,13:54.1
Marina Hair and Beauty Salon,"I had such a great experience with Marina Salon! My hairstylist was Hani. He was friendly, professional, and informative.

Glow Hair Studio,Kara and everyone in the salon is so fun and friendly. I always look and feel so good leaving! My blonde is always perfect. Deff recommend,5,13:54.7
Glow Hair Studio,"To start I have virgin natural  very  blonde hair. Apparently level 8.   I m  just blonde I ve never ever died my hair. I noticed my natural golden hair was losing its lustre  to be expected with age. After 2 years of contemplating  maybe  getting something to simply brighten up or bring back my once former bright blonde brightness . I fearfully took the plunge. To be honest I don t understand the world of hair color at all  After careful review and  creeping  on the stylist s and salons beforehand then having a consultation done with Kearn first to discuss color etc. Today I couldn t have been more happy to have had Kearn take care of my hair and so many of my fears. Kearn, I can t tell you how amazing you made me feel today. Thank you so much. You re sensational, dedicated and skilled! Kara thank you for the insightful conversation about small business and Sarah for washing my hair.  This is a salon that not only knows their business but knows how to reach people and create a sense of true comfort in the chair, they communicate, they listen and work together to make people like myself go home feeling like a million bucks. Thank you all.",5,13:54.7

Glow Hair Studio,Had an appointment for a cut and style with Kearn and I was so pleased! He was very personable and I trusted him immediately with my hair. I was so happy with the outcome. Cant wait to go back. Thanks!!,5,13:54.7
Glow Hair Studio,,5,13:54.7
Glow Hair Studio,"For the first time in four years, I left a hair salon happy and satisfied.  Happy  is an understatement, actually. Once I left the salon, my body started levitating and ever since then, I ve been flying around town. True story. My hairstylist, Kearn, is absolutely amazing and I will never, ever let him go!!! I showed up with a brassy, patchy hair looking to get an ombre, with dark roots and beautiful blond at the tips. Imagine a very cute worm politely requesting to become a butterfly. Yeah. Thankfully, Kearn accepted me as a client. He took time to go through my reference pictures before our appointment to understand exactly what I wanted. He also explained to me what to expect in terms of final result. It was important for me to manage my expectations due to the colour buildup left after the red hair phase I had last summer. Pro tip: GIRL, DO NOT DYE YOUR HAIR RED, ESPECIALLY AT HOME. After running things by equally talented and knowledgeable Kara, the co-owner of Glow Hair Studio, we came up with a plan that required me signing a waiver. One could say that both I and Kearn were taking a little bit of a risk that day and, oh my God, did it pay off! I got exactly what I wanted. Now I have the best hair in town and the rest of you will have to just deal with it Kearn is a perfectionist    Talented and knowledgeable professional, he is meticulous in everything he does. That being said, the five hours that we spent together were a real pleasure because of his natural charm and amazing sense of humour! He is really fun to chat with, but please, don t get carried away like I did at times: allow him to concentrate on working his magic! I could keep going or you could just take a look at my before/after pictures! To be fair, everybody seemed absolutely amazing. Kara assembled a great team. All the stylists and the support staff are extremely attentive and kind. Their slogan should be:  You are in good hands ! I will be recommending GHS to all my family and friends. Another pro tip: treat yourself to a glass of wine while getting your hair done, if that s your thing :) They have a nice selection of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Thank you, my loves",5,13:55.3
Glow Hair Studio,Another great hair appointment at Glow with Kearn. I was booked in for a balayage but after telling Kearn what I wanted to do with my hair he expertly pivoted to recommend a full head of highlights to give me the look I wanted (more blonde!). I love how my hair looks and can t wait for my next appointment. Sara did a great job with my shampoo/toner!,5,13:55.3
Glow Hair Studio,"I got my hair done today by Kearn. I am unbelievably happy with it! I left feeling fantastic. I also just want to give a shout out to Sara, that was also there today! Such a lovely & welcoming environment. Definitely coming back Services",5,13:55.3
Glow Hair Studio,Had an appointment with Kearn  all I can say is WOW! He did such an amazing job and was super welcoming as soon as I entered the salon he instantly made me feel welcome. He knew exactly what to do with my hair to get it to PERFECTION  I have had my hair done many times and have never been this happy with it! Pricing was very reasonable.

The recent addition of the work table to accommodate #bossgirls is a game-changer. Being able to stay productive while getting pampered is a nice touch!",5,13:55.8
Glow Hair Studio,"I have been seeing Kara since I moved to Ottawa (2 years ago). I absolutely adore her kindness and knowledge. She has helped me grow my hair out since a terrible experience at another salon. The entire team at Glow hair is kind, supportive and makes me feel as though Ive entered a family environment.

Bruno Racine Salon,"I moved to Ottawa from Toronto and I was going back and forth to Toronto to get my hair done. I was literally terrified of having someone else touch my hair. Well, guess what? I went to see Bruno and not only did he do an amazing job, he is super nice and accommodating. The staff is pleasant and the salon is great. Highly recommend to anyone looking for the perfect stylist and from what can see the other stylists are also very talented !",5,13:57.6
Bruno Racine Salon,"I made an appointment to get a root touch-up. The stylist was super friendly. The front desk was a bit of a mess. I believe a young girl was getting trained so things looked very unorganized with how they greeted me. I was in TOTAL shock at how dirty the salon was. I live 2min from this place. I walk my dog passed the salon every day. I have noticed how dirty this place looks from the outside windows. I honestly thought it was maybe just the outside windows but walking in was so disappointing. I asked the stylist if they were doing construction and he seemed a little embarrassed when I asked. He replied no.    I highly suggest the owner or manager hire a cleaner or hire a few assistants to help maintain during the day. The salon SHOULD be cleaned every day. The products need to be dusted off, the floors desperately need a mop, the windows outside are so gross and the ceiling had spider webs. The place looks like its never been cleaned before and everything and I mean everything is everywhere. Its sad see what can be such a beautiful spot look so dirty.  They need to hire a front desk that has better customer service. Please walk pass Ombel Salon and get some inspiration on how to maintain a clean place. I will not come back and I will not recommend this place. Its not just the service but the overall experience.",1,13:57.6
Bruno Racine Salon,There s nobody I trust more with my hair than Ben. 6 months ago he saved my hair after a botched haircut & balayage. I ve since become a regular customer and my hair has never looked better. I get so many compliments all the time. I m never switching hairdressers again.,5,13:57.6
Bruno Racine Salon,"Its a terrible, TERRIBLE place. I am in tears right now because they RUINED my hair. They managed to screw up on the simplest task! I asked to just darken my hair from light to dark blonde all over. Instead, they dumped some AUBURN BROWN all over my head with no application technique whatsoever, so now, as a result, my hair is three different colours, reddish at the roots, still very light in the middle and very DARK on the tips. It is also all blotchy! I do a much better job just using box hairdye on my own. How did these people ever get license?!! They have no idea what they are doing! Oh, and before pouring auburn brown dye on my head they tried to make my hair dark blonde with some orangey demi-permanent hairdye! The result was orange! Like WHAT?!! HOW do these people have a license?? They trap you with their agessive front desk customer service, push you to make an appointment, promise you to do everything in a fantastic way and then proceed to destroy your hair while you are sitting there and watching in horror as they ruin your hair. If you value yourself and your hair DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE. The salon itself looks kind of nice, but their skill level is non-existent! I had beautiful blonde hair, and now I am crying because I dont know how to fix this disaster they created, and whether or not my hair will be able to withstand it, because the only way to fix this ugly blochy auburn-ish mess is going to involve intense bleaching.",1,13:57.6
Bruno Racine Salon,"Excellent service from the moment you ask for an appointment to the moment you leave the salon, everyone is so kind and friendly, Gina always understands exactly what I want and always leave happy and satisfied with the service, would definitely recommend",5,13:57.6

Bruno Racine Salon,"*Updated review* The stylist Ive been seeing for awhile messed up my colour last year. And instead of refunding me for that portion of the services provided, they insisted on trying to fix it. Which then made the situation much worse. For reference I have very fine, easily damaged hair. I had asked for light brown highlights to compliment my natural tone.  Due to my fine hair and health issues, my hair cannot support multiple colourings. I then had to wait a year to get the colour corrected for a third time. Which they insisted Bruno would do himself, to ensure the service provided was correct and what I had asked for. I again asked for light brown highlights to match my natural tone. What I received  was all over dark mahogany with purple tones. I again requested a refund as I no longer trust the salon to touch my hair. I also have a wedding in a month, that I now have to damage my hair further to correct. I was told to wait; over an hour, to resolve the issue at the salon and then was also told they cannot process the refund for at least another week. This has been a huge waste of my time, my resources, and my emotional wellbeing. And it still isnt resolved. ******************************************* It has been over a month since Bruno Racine confirmed I would be getting a refund. They have ignored my attempts to follow up and have promised several callbacks without action. No refund has been received. I didnt think I could be any more disappointed in this salon. Having been a loyal client of theirs for many years Im truly disgusted with the way this has been handled.",1,13:57.6

Bruno Racine Salon,I am very disappointed by a hair straightening service I recently received from Bruno Racine Salon. The hair straightening product they applied to my hair did not work and severely damaged it. I reached out several times to talk to Bruno (the owner) and even showed up in person once. But he refused to speak to me and solve the issue each time. They avoided resolving the issue or providing a reasonable solution for the damage they created.,1,13:58.8

Bruno Racine Salon,"Ben is my stylist, he is very talented and I trust him 100% with my hair. I told him he cant leave because it took me 4 bad haircuts at other high rated salons after moving to Ottawa to find him. He fixed my haircut and after I was comfortable enough I asked him for a bayalage which got my Asian black hair to blonde in one session. I wouldnt go to anyone else,  highly recommend.",5,13:59.4

Vespa Hair Design,"Alberto cut my hair and it is the best cut I have had in a long time.  He took his time, designed the shape/movement/style and my husband told me I look the best he has seen in years. I feel terrific and will be returning to Vespa and Albertos mastery.",5,14:01.1
Vespa Hair Design,Hubby is looking Hot!!! Maybe I should not drop him here again for a snazzy new cut by Alberto . Have your hubby get himself a babe magnet style here at your own peril. Update: I allowed hubby to return to the salon for another masterpiece by Alberto . Afterwards we took in the tulip festival and I kept hubby in my sights at all times for fear that seeing him and his hairstyle tiptoeing through the tulips would invoke a riot.,5,14:01.1
Vespa Hair Design,Im not a woman who goes to salons. But I was desperate.  Have you ever given yourself a Tequila trim.Alfredo is the best.,5,14:01.1
Vespa Hair Design,Rajaa gave me my confidence back and I am so grateful for her! I have had terrible experiences with hairstylists in the past. I have relatively thin hair from stress-related hairloss that Im fighting to get back. The last person I went to actually told me I was losing my beauty and should figure out whats going on and it ruined my confidence. Rajaa was exactly the person I needed to see:  so incredibly kind and sweet and listened to everything I had to say. She made my hair feel fuller and gave me everything I wanted for. I feel so much better about going to the salon again and its all thanks to her! I cant wait to see her again in a few months for a touch up on my hair. I never thought Id be able to say that. Thank you so much Rajaa!,5,14:01.1

Vespa Hair Design,"I booked an appointment for myself and my Mom for an updo. We were coming from out of town, so I checked out the reviews.

I cannot say enough good things about how polite, professional, talented, and amazing Rajaa was! She gave us such classy and stylish updo s! We felt so wonderful when we left and received so many compliments on our hair. Thank you so much! Service:",5,14:01.1
Vespa Hair Design,"My second attempt at finding my hair stylist since moving here from Toronto. Rajaaa is a very serious stylist. She did what I requested meticulously and beautifully. No small talk, just laser focus and perfectionism. I should have actually listened to her suggestion of how to cut my bob, but scarred by previous experiences, I played it safe. I was very safe in her capable hands. Dont hesitate going to Rajaa and to Vespa. I know I will.",5,14:01.1
Vespa Hair Design,I look amazing. Still a great studio since my last post.,5,14:01.1
Vespa Hair Design,"I have been going to Vespa pretty much since it opened and have been seeing Michael for the last several years. I have always been incredibly happy with his work - I have very straight Asian hair that can sometimes be very uncooperative especially when trying to style it (e.g. adding curls), but Michael has always been able to handle my hair easily and I often leave his salon with beautiful soft curls that actually stay in for the rest of the day and into the next day! He is also very personable and easy to talk to, not to mention very skilled and knowledgeable. He has always taken the time to explain things and answer my questions without being pushy about treatments or upselling anything, which is very refreshing. He and his team have always treated me with kindness and its always a treat to go in to see them. I encourage you to check out Vespa - you wont be sorry! Thanks so much, Michael and the Vespa team! - Chrissy",5,14:01.1
Vespa Hair Design,"I came here with high hopes  based on the reviews but sadly I was let down. I only got my hair coloured  and it cost me over $350, although the women was super sweet I had problems communicating with her (I speak both english and french) which I find super important when  it comes to describing what I want (especially if Im paying that much) she also told me to pass her the aluminum foils and brushes throughout the full appointment even when I express I just really want to just be on my phone and enjoy it. I said I didn t want a style and hair dry but she did it anyways and then escorted me with the owner to the cashier and stood in-front of the door while I paid which made me feel like pretty belittled. Being honest I didn t think based in their website that the hair colour would be 350$ but i didn t feel comfortable disputing  that since they already treated me as a potential dine and dasher  i would never come back.",1,14:01.1

I took my mom to this hair salon for a hair cut from a senior hair dresser ( I will not give names) and she came out with a very short hair cut that she did not like at all! My mom is a very polite person so she would not be rude or complaining to anyone even if the situation is not pleasant. My mom showed a picture as a guide and explained her needs but the hair dresser basically just went exactly like the picture and it did not work. A senior hair dresser should be able to comment or guide the customer in terms of their facial shape, hair type and what would look good and what would not. This was not the case. Also, she was not focused at all on my mom, kept trying to answer or chat people around her.",1,14:04.5

First Choice Hair,So disappointing today. I went in with my daughter. After asking over and over if it would be easier to get our curly hair cut washed instead of dry I had to absolutely insist my daughters hair was washed first so she didnt have to sit there and get her curly hair brushed out with a comb. My stylest kept dropping his comb and brush then continued to use them on me. Both of us have layered hair and I asked if they were going to cut more than just the bottom all around and neither of them did. I paid over 80$ for both of us to leave with our hair half uncut and needing to find a different place to get it fixed. I dont understand why they didnt trim all the hair but maybe they just werent used to doing layers in womens hair. I wish it would have been easier to get what I asked for because I mentioned my dead ends in my growing out bangs and nothing even happened to them. I would have refused to pay until it was fixed but my daughter is autistic and the confrontation would have made it worse than losing out on the money.,1,14:08.5

Jet Black Hair & Studio,"Every three months, my roots and I visit Maddie at Jet Black Hair for some serious bleaching, toning, hydrating and a trim. For as long as it takes, usually several hours, Maddie dedicates her time and full attention to my hair. She makes sure its lightened enough to accept the silvery blonde tone that I like and healthy enough to stay strong afterwards. This kind of blonde is a real challenge, especially if your hair is naturally as dark as mine. Previous stylists have left me with breakage or the wrong tone, but I know Im in good hands with Maddie, long may she stay in Ottawa. I love this shade of oyster blonde that shes able to achieve for me, if only it would grow out of my head this way.",5,14:14.4

Due to my hair being previously coloured, it took a couple rounds of toner to achieve the desired look   Jacinta really took her time to make sure she got it right. What stood out to me the most was the camaraderie between the staff. They seem to really support one another in a genuine way which contributes to the pleasant atmosphere of the salon.

Fringe & Foliage,"Had a wonderful haircut here earlier in the summer from the wonderful Shannon, whod been recommended by a friend. I gave her half a dozen conflicting instructions and she managed to fufil them all, much to my delight, despite the added stress of a massive storm and tornado warnings at the time! The cut has lasted very well since then, which is just what I needed as I live far from the madding crowd and decent hairdressers :-) Lovely place, great people and fabulous haircut - totally recommended!",5,14:24.1
Fringe & Foliage,"I had the most pleasant and comforting experience here. I walked in looking for flowers (old listing) but its now a hair/plant shop I chatted quick with one girl doing someones hair and juniper was at the front desk, they asked if I wanted a plant instead but I laughed and said no, but asked if theyd wash my hair as I have not washed it in a few months... they were extremely soft spoken/fragile with me and got right to it. If you have ever been in a situation where you cant brush your hair due to sickness or depression youd know how upsetting it is having a matted head. I reminded him multiple times that if it wasnt easy he could stop, but that did not stop juniper. They brushed my hair out for a good hour, all the tangle mats and knots and got me feeling like myself again... come to find out juniper doesnt even really deal with hair that much even though they went to school for it, he handles the plants! So I was a walk in with a mess, I was taken care of immediately in a comfortable non judgemental way. I have so much love for the people here and I will forever keep coming back.

Hasami salon,The fee structure should be properly explained. They charged me more than the website fee and refused to refund me once when I pointed it out to them. I then got a partial refund but not the entire difference. I was disappointed and will not be going back.,1,14:27.4
Hasami salon,"I received a really good haircut. Theres no doubt about the hairstylists skills. Although the hair service was done quickly, it was not thorough enough. The staff was lacking in customer service, especially when it came to paying attention to the finer details of the haircut, which made it feel rushed. I got the hair services done 20 minutes earlier than the time scheduled, and was directed to pay right after. After examining my face closely in the mirror, I had to request more precise adjustments. There was hair all over my face that the stylist didnt bother wiping away. Although I hear great reviews, Im disappointed that the customer service isnt up to par with the price they charge. Regrettably, the overall experience is not spectacular compared to other places.",3,14:27.4

Ill come back later. I will be a regular! I usually wait until I go back to Japan for a haircut, but I really wanted it asap this time as my 6-month-old baby was pulling my hair. I heard about Hasami salon from a friend of mine last year, so I emailed to inquire. Hitomi promptly responded and confirmed which type of appointment I should select based on photos and descriptions of my ideal hairstyle. On the appointment day, Miho took care of me. She was very detail oriented and lovely to chat with. I was happy with my final look. I m glad to be able to enjoy the Japanese hospitality in Ottawa. Highly recommend!

I remember when I was looking for a hair dresser in Ottawa and was pretty apprehensive as I am very particular about my hair. I was referred to Sarah by a friend of mine and I havent looked back since. Im pretty sure my first appointment was within the first few weeks of Salon Bliss being in the space they are now. I fully and whole heartedly trust Sarah with my hair. Every time she has done a wonderful job, is clearly so talented and is an excellent listener to all of my stories. Sarah always puts the customer first and will do whatever is necessary to make sure you are taken care of.

She is a wealth of knowledge in not only hair, but so, so much more. Thank you for the beautiful start to my Saturday, cant wait to come back soon <3",5,14:30.8
Salon Bliss,"I really love coming here to see Sarah. The first impression is a large industrial space with lots of natural light. But it very quickly turns into this wonderful cosy place to hang out and spoil yourself. As for Sarah. Funny, intelligent creative woman with an amazing eye for what works on her clients and years of experience turning ideas into beautiful reality Love you Sarah",5,14:30.8
Salon Bliss,"This place messed up my friends hair. When she called back initially, they offered to put toner in her hair, which is appreciated, but didnt fix the fact that they fried her hair. When she called a second time to address the fact that her hair was still fried, but now orange because of the toner, they refused to look at her hair or help her beyond what theyve done with the toner. She ended up needing to dye her hair black and chopping the fried ends off. Not a curly hair friendly place even though they claim to have a curly hair specialist.",1,14:30.8

Salon Bliss,"Had a fantastic experience at this salon! From the moment I walked in I felt welcome, pampered and listened to. I was nervous about losing too much length after many bad experiences with stylists going scissor-crazy, and the stylist at Salon Bliss listened to my concerns and checked in with me frequently to make sure I was okay with the amount she was cutting. In the end I got exactly what I asked for: my hair - but BETTER. Couldnt be more confident with the cut. Definitely found my new go-to salon.",5,14:31.4
Salon Bliss,An excellent experience from start to finish. Sarah was really knowledgeable and gave me the most personalized experience Ive ever had at a salon.  My hair looks and feels fantastic now!,5,14:31.4
Salon Bliss,"I have been seeing Sarah for over a decade and she has played an important role in my evolving style. No one else in Ottawa is allowed to touch my hair. That said, I didn t realize how this same experience could also impact my nine year old daughter. We allowed her to get highlights recently, something that I thought would be a relatively fun yet benign experience. It has been transformative for our daughter. Who knew that acid green colour blocking would be the finishing touch to helping her to define her current style. It has given her confidence and the behavioural outcomes in her school and social interactions has been immediately  evolved for the better. Never underestimate the power of good hair changing your world. And trust the level of excellence at Salon Bliss to do that.",5,14:31.4

Salon Bliss,Everyone at Salon Bliss is so kind and welcoming! I have had cuts with both Sarah and Michelle. Both are so talented and non-judgemental. I have very thin and damaged hair and in the past I ve dreaded going in for a cut at some places / before moving to Ottawa. Salon Bliss is the first place I ve been where I ve felt totally comfortable. Would recommend them any day,5,14:31.4

Maison Noi,High quality and the latest fashion cuts and colour! I love Emile and Robin!,5,14:32.6
Maison Noi,"Ive been going to this Maison Noi for a year now, and I leave every visit happy and satisfied. The ambiance with the live plants creates a soothing atmosphere; the staffs friendliness and expertise make each experience truly enjoyable. The results of getting my hair colored are consistently fantastic, and I leave the salon feeling confident and rejuvenated every time. With the added convenience of free parking and a great location, this salon has truly become my go-to destination.",5,14:32.6
Maison Noi,"I have known Emilie and Robin for almost 20 years. It s so fitting that their salon is called  Maison  as everyone is welcome and they make you feel like you truly belong and you are home. In the almost two decades of cutting my curly hair and doing colour I leave every visit feeling rejuvenated and amazing! Thwe, Thai and Haesol are super and the salon has such a warm feeling you can tell everyone supports each other and cares deeply about their clients, taking such pride in their work. I love also that they offer their time to support organizations such as Dress for Success by donating hair services to empower women to get back into the work force and feel confident. At the height of Covid their team also donated their time to thank our health care workers with hair cuts. I also look forward to participating in their annual support the Food Bank cause around holiday. They also seek out staff that is culturally diverse and they are given the training and resources to really shine. I ve seen their staff over the years really come into their own and you will be happy to have the experience in anyone s chair!",5,14:32.6
Maison Noi,"Robin has been cutting my hair for 4 years, and not only do I value his services, but hes been professional, welcoming, and accomodating. His excellent knowledge has served me well, I will absolutely continue getting my hair cut by Robin and I cant  recommend his salon enough.",5,14:32.6
Maison Noi,"Maison Noi is my go to hair salon for the past 3 years and the results have been nothing less than perfect! Emilie has always able to get the exact hair style/colour every time and her attention to details is what I really appreciate. I want to also mention that the service here is impeccable. All the staff are friendly and very talented stylists.  They immediately greet you at the door and take your jacket as well. They always check up on me and ask if I need anything like water or a snack which is something I think adds a special touch to the experience. I ve never had this kind of service at my previous salons, so it was a pleasant surprise for me.",5,14:32.7
Maison Noi,"Emilie has been my hairdresser for over a decade, and Ive followed her from various salons to Maison Noi, and even though I moved to Nova Scotia 5 years ago and cant get in for all my hair needs, I still think of her as my hair stylist. She has done a FABULOUS job on my absurd half curly/half frizzy, greying hair over the years. Emilie is the most kind hearted and generous person you can imagine, and she has transferred that into a business that supports its staff and community in amazing ways. Ive been around long enough to be a model for Thwe as she was apprenticing, and she is sooo wonderful, attentive, and talented. Emilie and Robin have worked hard to create a genuinely multi-cultural and welcoming salon in Ottawa. They support global and local development needs, whether supporting the Rohingya refugees from Myanmar or the local food bank. You wont just get an amazing hairstyle at Maison Noi. When you walk in, youll genuinely feel like youre visiting friends.",5,14:32.7
Maison Noi,"Emilie has been my hair stylist for about 15 years. I followed her to her different salons and my daughter also became one of her faithful clients. No one cuts hair like her, so precise.  I ve gotten many compliments on my hair thanks to her.  Maison Noi has also supported the community by offering cuts for essential workers when pandemic restrictions first lifted. This is a salon with heart.",5,14:33.2
Maison Noi,"my whole family, including my children (2+5) have been visiting Maison Noi since it opened. We have had many great experiences here. Every part of the experience from booking, to leaving with a fresh hair cut is pleasant. It is easy to book services through their website, The staff are friendly and welcoming, the salon is clean and has a great atmosphere to relax and the hair cuts are always on point. My children are young, and sometimes not the greatest the clients but they always leave with nice haircuts and incredibly straight bangs. I would highly recommend this salon! Annnnnd for a downtown salon I have never had trouble finding parking when visiting!",5,14:33.2
Maison Noi,"Absolutely love getting my hair cut by Thwe. She is so attentive, patient and truly listens to what youd like. Ive been going to Maison Noi for years and highly recommend it!",5,14:33.2
Maison Noi,The staff at Maison Noi is amazing! I ve had my hair done by everyone in the salon at some point and they ve all been extremely professional.  Keep up the great work.,5,14:33.2
Maison Noi,"Robin and team are great! The salon is always clean, lively, and well-maintained. The staff are super friendly. I ve been seeing Robin for the past 7 or so years (moved with him when he opened Maison Noi!). He provides top-notch services and is super well educated with all things hair! He s very honest when it comes to how the inspiration photos I show him will look with my heavy straight hair I actually really appreciate this honesty and he s always able to educate me on why something may or may not work. I always recommend Maison Noi to anyone looking for hair services. Apparently they have a pretty awesome roster of staff who provide excellent curly cuts. While I can t personally attest to this, I know a few people who have received a curly cut and have been pleased with the outcome.",5,14:33.2
Maison Noi,Amazing staff!,5,14:33.2
Maison Noi,"Absolutely amazing experience! I have 3B/3C curls, and Haesol took the best care of them. The cut was perfect and affordable!",5,14:33.2

Maison Noi,I ve been going here for over a year and am always thoroughly impressed and happy with my cut and colour. Haesol does a wonderful job and she s super friendly. The staff are so inviting and kind and it s a really great atmosphere.,5,14:33.2
Maison Noi,"I ve been getting my hair done by Emelie for the last few years and I can say that even though I live down the street, I would drive across the city to see her! The level of care and professionalism shown by the owners and staff is top tier and I am always 110% satisfied with the services I receive. On top of that, the salon is super cute and I also always feel welcomed there.  Very user-friendly online booking, but make sure to book early as the spots do fill up fast. Hard to find a salon that ticks all the boxes so I feel lucky to have found them!",5,14:33.2

Maison Noi,"I rarely ever return to the same hairdresser/salon (or leave a review) but Maison Noi is an exceptional place! Despite it s unassuming location, the salon is a functional space with a beautifully curated style and aesthetic that is kept in immaculate condition. The stylists and staff are very nice, professional, understanding, and accommodating. The online booking system is very easy to use - and would encourage those looking for an appointment to use it as the stylists get booked up due to high demand and can t always accommodate last minute walk-ins. The prices are very reasonable compared to other salons and I have always been extremely pleased with the results - Thwe is amazing! Maison Noi is a place that has clearly been created out of passion and dedication, with every detail being chosen thoughtfully - from the (genius) power outlets hanging from the ceiling for styling tools (leaving the floors free from cluttered wires), the system they have in place for preparing and sanitizing styling stations and tools pre and post-appointment, to the beautifully appointed hair washing stations. Absolutely love the place!",5,14:33.8

Maison Noi,"From the first moment I walked into Maison Noi, I knew that staff was eager to provide the best of care and customer service, making me feel welcome from the get-go. Robin is a magician regarding hair color and mixed a shade that looks better on me than any other color any hairdresser has ever applied. Emilie who is an expert on working with curly hair, gave me the perfect cut and a length that complements my features. They are an excellent team, supplemented by professional and thoroughly trained staff. The place is kept spotlessly clean and the atmosphere is pleasant. I highly recommend Maison Noi. I know that I am in the best of hands.",5,14:34.4

Westboro Spa & Hair Studio,When I parked in the last parking spot before my appointment a staff member had arrived after me (receptionist) in her car and asked me to give her the spot because she was staff. So staff have a priority over clients? There is only two client parking spots the rest you have to find on the street. There were no staff only parking signs. I had to drive around the block and park on one of the side streets and walk to my appointment. Very bad vibes after that. Very unprofessional. Connie was good.,2,14:34.9
Westboro Spa & Hair Studio,"Had the most incredible experience with Lindsey at Westboro Spa & Hair Studio. Came in not knowing what I wanted or needed except that I did not like my hair from a previous experience, and said a bunch of things that ultimately would not have resulted in the look I was going for - but Lindsey asked me lots of questions and showed me pictures of different looks that ultimately got me this result and I really love it! She also colour corrected my hair, recommended a salon style shampoo that ll help my hair retain its colour (proactively keeping in the colour is key - and the shampoo was only $35! Not that much more expensive than the one I was buying which was peeling colour off my hair). Lindsey has gained a loyal customer for all future hair appointments. I suggest all Brondes make their way over to Westboro Spa & Hair Salon and ask for Lindsey s expertise!",5,14:34.9
Westboro Spa & Hair Studio,"I love seeing Esti for sugaring. Absolute the best. Was a client of  hers from Luxe for the longest time. But the only downside is the drive to Westboro is too far, and the small space for parking.",3,14:34.9

Westboro Spa & Hair Studio,Friendly people and great service!!!,5,14:35.5
Westboro Spa & Hair Studio,"My hairdresser was inexperienced. She did not ask anything about the style or the length. I told her  no bangs . She said  yes  and cut the bangs even shorter for the second time. Without asking, she put the iron in my hair to straighten it. No, I do not want my hair straight! Then, trying to  fix  the bad cut, she was trying to puff my hair with the brush. When almost done, I ask about texturing. She said that she is always doing it when the hair is dry. And she chopped even more from one side of the head. I went there because I badly needed a hair cut to boost my morale. Left in tears, with the hair chopped like they used a knife to cut it and not the scissors. My worst hair cut I ever had. Definitely will not return. Now I have to wait two months until the hair will grow to an acceptable length so I can give it a nice, complimentary style.",1,14:35.5

Westboro Spa & Hair Studio,"I got a recommendation to go to Westboro Spa from a friend. She has only been there for a haircut but I went in for Colour. Big Mistake. Ana has no idea what she is doing at all . She said she had 5 years experience but I have a hard time believing that. You cannot be that awful and have that much experience. She has no clue how to colour, tone or do anything properly. My hair came out a mess. I don t mean just in one spot it s splotchy, has dark spots, light spots in the wrong area, etc. I made sure to check their website and instagram and it s a joke. It s definitely not her work. On top of it I paid over $360 for my Colour without a cut!! Please be aware . There are amazing salons out there but unfortunately this is not one of them.",1,14:36.1

I called Westboro Spa & Hair Salon just from a google search (they were close by) and they graciously booked me in with Lina. She was friendly, kind and listened to what I wanted. I was going from longer to shorter hair (a little risky for an unfamiliar stylist) she did a fantastic job. I left feeling so happy, and with this humidity I was grateful, lol.

I was looking at turning my blue post pandemic hair into a beautiful balyage but was left with orange-y roots and tears from his insults.  Yes, I had dyed my hair from a box, but that doesnt mean someone like him has to insult me. It took me a while to write this review, giving it 1 star. I was called 3 times by the salon asking me why I left a one star... this is why. JS needs to learn to watch what he says to clients he does not know... He comes off rude and insulting.",1,14:37.8

Precision Styling - Hair Salon Ottawa,Update Dec 2023! Just had my hair cut by Becky and she was amazing! I showed her a photo and she was able to give me exactly what I wanted while working with my hair type. Her advice meant it came out even better than I had thought it would! Cannot recommend her enough! Great service and were able to fit me in earlier when my plans for the day brought me to the mall almost 2 hours early. Very happy with the eyebrow waxing!,5,14:39.6

Precision Styling - Hair Salon Ottawa,Had my first waxing appoint with Zeze. Probably the most efficient and professional waxing I have ever had.,5,14:39.6
Precision Styling - Hair Salon Ottawa,"I had not very pleasant experience with this salon this time. My stylist didn t give me cut I asked her to give me, I asked for lots of layers which should give me volume and she keeps on saying that volume you will only get with the products. I agreed to chop big chunk of my hair to have layers but she didn t do as asked and just chopped it and was done with my haircut in 20 mins and I was shocked. I usually go to Nathalie but this time I was in hurry so didn t get her appointment and i am very unhappy with my haircut. On top of that what I didn t like that when I was paying for my bill she was standing right there until I tipped her, which was very rude behavior and I felt like I am forced to tip her So overall i lost my hair length , didn t get my required haircut and volume but did get  disappointment for sure. ** EDITING MY RESPONE***** I am unable to reply to your unfair response on my review. So editing this to give response Gaslighting your client is not a professional way to handle criticism. I was not late, my appointment was at 1pm and I was there on time.  I rather had to wait and when I asked how long , I was told to wait 10 mins which I patiently did.  I am not sure what makes you say I was late or you are confusing me with someone else. Then I explained her that I wanted lots of layers to add volume to my hair. She then proceeded with cut - mind you I didn t ask her one time to rush and rather was surprised that she finished so quick in 20 mins. With half my hair length chopped, I confronted her that she didn t add layers like I asked and she responded that she can add now. I told her it would mean I won t have any length left and she said yes. I have had great service from other stylist here in past, so nothing against salon, just this experience. Also not expecting any discounts or complimentary service ( I don t have length left to have correction- need to grow it out before any further cut) but honestly pointing out why I was disappointed with service and then your response) Maybe take it positively and improve on it.",1,14:39.6

Precision Styling - Hair Salon Ottawa,"I recently got a keratin hair treatment done with Maria, and I can not be more shocked at the results. My goal was to get rid of my curly/wavy, thick and frizzy hair that was completly unmanagable. From the start Maria was very honest with me and told me that due to my hair type, the keratin treatment wouldn t make my hair 100% straight, but that it would definitly address some of my goals . In the pictures below you will see : 1) My hair at its curliest 2) My hair in its usual wavy / frizzy state 3) My hair after my first wash 4) My hair after a few minor corrections (done at home with a hair straightener) My hair truly feels brand new, its SO soft and so much more managable than before. Although their are spot where i still see frizz and a slight wave/curl, im still very happy by the results. It usually takes me 30-60 minutes to get my hair presentable to leave my house, now it takes 10. Thank you so much to Maria and the Precision Hairstyling team, i was so nervous for this treatment at first but the results speak for themselves. :) UPDATE: This treatment had a noticeable longevity of 6 months for me and my hair.",4,14:39.6

Hair on Second Avenue,"Summary: got my hair cut here last year, still dealing with the fallout and waiting for the damage done to grow out - literally the worst haircut I have ever gotten I debated writing this review for a long time because I didn t want to be negative, but I feel I have to say something, especially as I am still dealing with the consequences of coming to this salon. My appointment was around July of last year. I have thick, healthy, very slightly wavy hair, and I for an above the shoulders cut and for layers to add some movement. Keep in mind that I ve had layers done many times before, so I know what they are supposed to look like. I don t know exactly what happened, or why they would do this, but the stylist THINNED OUT my hair so much that   and I am not joking or exaggerating whatsoever   the ends curled up like those of a CARTOON CHARACTER S (think Olive Oil from Popeye). It was bizarre. My hair did this for MONTHS, no matter whether I let my hair airdry out of the shower or whether I tried to fight back with styling creams and a curling iron, in which case it would look better for maybe a day before reverting back. Whatever they did made it so that my hair REJECTED styling attempts, obviously the opposite of what I wanted. It has finally grown enough now that we have been able to trim some of this thinned hair out, although the stylist made sure to thin out the top as well, so I am still having problems. Another problem I am still dealing with is the FRIZZ. I have never had frizzy hair, nor any heat damage as I avoid using damaging styling techniques. I wanted to encourage waves and texture; instead, the excessive thinning means that I get to fight the frizz every time I wash my hair, or settle for hair that looks DAMAGED. For the record: I have experience with different hair textures as members of my family have hair that is much curlier than mine, so I know the problem is the cut, not my styling techniques. Like I said, things have improved because I have grown out some of the damage, but it will probably be another 6 months before I finally have my thick, healthy-looking hair back. I regret having to write this, but since the damage is ongoing I felt compelled to say something.",1,14:44.4

I came in with multicoloured brown, damaged, brittle hair and he transformed it and my confidence in just one session. He is honest and kind and I ll be forever thankful! I use to have major anxiety going to salons and have always avoided them but Roger has given me nothing but positive results and comfort! Now im going back for my third session in July! Eeek! Thank you Roger!!!",5,14:49.8
Salon My Place,The salon was exceptional. The atmosphere is not only inviting and friendly but the talent of the team is amazing. Roger fixed my hair from orange hues to a beautiful golden brown without further damaging my hair. He gave me my dream hair while making me laugh the whole time. The whole experience was warm and refreshing and this place is my go to from now on!,5,14:49.8

And she always tells you to come back if you arent happy or want anything changed.  I have no hesitation at all in recommending her services to anyone.",5,14:49.8
Salon My Place,"What an awesome salon. Ive been here a few times now and had the pleasure of working with Rebecka, Susan and Roger. I had fantastic experiences with everyone. Most recently, Roger did an absolutely amazing job colouring my hair. I asked for a tricky highlight/lowlight/balayage strawberry blond and boy did he deliver! I am beyond excited with my new look and cannot stress enough how great Roger was to work with. He really took the time to understand what I wanted and came up with a creative solution to deliver amazing results.",5,14:49.8
Salon My Place,"This review is in no way a reflection of Alison and her incredible salon. I was a client of hers years ago and always loved the amazing service she provided. However, in November 2023, I saw Susan as Alison wasn t available for color and a cut. Susan butchered my hair. The color wasn t too bad but the cut was awful. I have never cried over a bad cut or color but once I got into my car, I sobbed the entire drive home to Stittsville. On top of that, the bill came to $400! I left a generous tip of $55, which looking back, I should never have given. I understand the product prices have gone up however, to charge someone $350 for a root touch up, maybe 6 foils and a butcher job for a haircut is unacceptable. I m still seething and my hair is still recovering sadly. It s taking forever to grow back. I ve been wearing it tied back most days because I just can t do anything with it. I have since seen someone for a trim, just to even it out. It was an inch and a half longer on the left side.   I feel so bad for leaving such a low review, but Alison, if you re reading this, it s not a reflection of you and the incredible salon you ve built. Your new space is absolutely stunning!",1,14:49.8

Salon My Place,"The salon s new Hintonburg location is spacious, bright and so lovely! I ve had several blowouts done with the team but this was my first time booking a  curly cut  with Rebecka. I ve tried a few other curly cuts in the city with other salons, but hadn t yet achieved the look I was hoping for. Rebecka really went above and beyond to achieve exactly the cut I was hoping for! She was knowledgeable, friendly and patient, and took the time to listen and share her recommendations, discuss her process, share her styling and care tips, and ensure I was happy with it before I left. She also encouraged me to follow up if I needed any tweaks made after styling at home, which I so appreciated. Will definitely be returning for another curly cut and other services!",5,14:50.3
Salon My Place,I had an appointment with Roger yesterday. He cut and styled my hair so fabulously! I love it.

I had never had my (very long) hair coloured or layered, and in addition, I decided to go for a subtle balayage.  Rebecka was so welcoming, warm, patient, and knowledgeable that I was completely at ease during the entire process.  I cannot believe the difference in how I look and feel!  I am now a client for life and will definitely be returning in the future.  Roger was very kind and helpful as well during the process.  Lisa was also there serving other clients and her warmth and friendliness contributed to the overall relaxed and pleasant atmosphere.  I would not hesitate to recommend to others to use the services of Salon My Place, especially for newbies like myself.  Thank you SO MUCH, Rebecka, for your exceptional service!",5,14:51.5

Everyone is skilled, personable, and great at interpreting my vague and uncertain ideas about what I want done with my hair into great styles. It is also the first salon where I have never felt pressured to colour my (increasingly silver) hair or buy product. They always have great suggestions when asked, however, and I do buy their products because they are awesome quality and last a long time! I also like how they always ask permission before using products which shows their sensitivity to those who may be sensitive to fragrances or just prefer their hair completely without products. Salon My Place embodies everything a small business should and I recommend them to everyone.",5,14:51.5

Anna Hair Design,"I found this hair salon by accident and I have to say that it was the best accident ever. I need to do something with the washed out, dry, patchy look of my hair from years of highlights and so I went there to find out what I could do. Two stylists did an evaluation and both agreed that bleaching my hair was not a good idea rather I should try to bring it back to the original colour so that it wasnt patchy anymore. I did have my doubts but they were right. What I left with was a beautifully rich look and the cost was nowhere near what I had paid for my half a head of highlights. Annas is professional, knowledgeable and especially affordable and I now have a new stylist that I hope to go back to for many years. Highly recommended!",5,14:52.7

Mai Mai 2 Beauty Salon,,5,14:57.4
Mai Mai 2 Beauty Salon,"If I could rate higher than 5 stars for the service I received, I would. Im from out of town and dont know of any salons in the city. I visited this local salon specifically because I was looking for a hairstylist that understood how to cut Asian male hair, and Mai did not disappoint. Highly, highly recommend everyone to visit this salon. BOOKING: I called on a Friday afternoon looking for a same-day or next-day appointment. They were fairly busy and booked up for the weekend, but Mai did her best to accommodate, and she offered to cut my hair after hours (around 6:30 - 7PM, which is after their Friday closing time of 6PM), or I could take my chances the following morning and be on a waitlist. I was planning on just visiting during their Saturday hours, but happened to be free and in the area around 6:30PM, so I called to see if she was still available, which she happily agreed and told me to swing by. HAIRCUT: Before starting, Mai took the time to go through a style book and explained the differences in hair lengths for different styles, provided opinions on what she thought would look better, but also listened to my personal preferences and input before we agreed on a specific hairstyle. She was quick and efficient, and checked in throughout the appointment whether I still liked the lengths of certain parts, and whether any adjustments were needed. The haircut was exactly as advertised and what I was looking for. SERVICE: I cannot speak to the service of other hairstylists at this salon, but if theyre anything like Mai (the owner), then youll be provided with incredible customer service. She was very friendly and greeted me with a smile as soon as I walked in. If you have the chance, book your appointment with Mai. Shes very personable, loves meeting new clients from all walks of life, and was very easy to converse with during the appointment. She was attentive throughout the haircut and its clear hairstyling isnt just a job for her, but rather her passion. She treated me as if I was a regular and I could tell she really cared to give me a haircut that would make me feel and look my best! PRICE: Very reasonable pricing, and cheaper than most other salons around the city for the same services (~$30 for a haircut & wash vs. $35-40 for a haircut at other salons). OVERALL: It was the first time in 15+ years that Ive been to a hairdresser other than my usual one (since Im only visiting for a few months due to work but desperately needed a haircut), so I was a bit nervous going in. Mai put me at ease and provided spectacular service throughout the entire appointment. Visiting this salon completely changed my outlook on what a haircut appointment experience should be like, and has set a new standard for me. Its no surprise that clients from all over and out of town would make the journey just to have their haircut at Mai Mai.",5,14:57.4

Raba Hair Studio,"The barber was very good, and we had a great conversation in i really liked that he took the time to explain to me how to style it on my own, how my hair was going to grow out etc. great service!",5,15:04.3
Raba Hair Studio,"When I first started going to Sam, he was attentive and cut my hair well, but lately he has not been at his best. I would try to give him photos and be very specific with my directions and then he would just forget what I told him and do things that I didn t ask for. He always made up for it when he made mistakes by giving me the cut for free if he really messed up, but after a while I would just be so nervous about what he was going to do that neither of us could relax. Anyway, the final time I went I had an appointment and he was running 25 min late so I asked if we were going to start soon because I had an appointment to get to after my cut. Rather than just letting me sit there waiting, the professional thing to do would be to apologize and let me know how long I would have to wait so I could decide whether or not I might want to go out and do some other chores, etc. He didn t apologize and simply told me that this was  the nature of the business  and then told me he wouldn t cut my hair any more because I was never happy and it stresses him out too much. I did my best to work with him and give him feedback during this whole time, and I frustrated that he treated me like this in the end. I think he is just taking on too many clients and he is burning himself out. His rates are lower than other places though, so if you don t mind taking a chance and have a relatively simple cut, it will probably be fine, but don t go to Sam if you think you might need to give corrections or constructive criticism",2,15:04.3

The Hair Boutique - Hair Salon Ottawa,"I got my hair cut on March 27. I asked for multiple layered haircut and mid length curtain bangs. I came fully prepared with two picture samples of what I am asking for. I felt rushed to explain my haircut styles, as I was being directed by the stylist to the washing area as soon as it was my turn. I had to ask her repeatedly to have a look at the pictures. The result was horrible. She gave me short bangs and 2 layered haircut. I left the place in tears. I am embarrassed with the haircut. I even went to another salon for styling tips as my bangs are cut so horribly. I have been to Hair Boutique 3 times to the same stylist. I realized the only time I left satisfied was the first time when I had only asked for a trim. The 2nd time my hair was cut short and I was asked to maybe bring in pictures which would help the stylist understand what I am asking for. It was not a bad cut, just a bit short. However, I did feel rushed, as they leave no time for hair consultation. So my 3rd time, I came fully prepared. I would not recommend this place.",1,15:07.3

The Hair Boutique - Hair Salon Ottawa,Went to this place yesterday because I wanted to try a new hair salon very unhappy with the service I asked more than three times for my hair to be cut all same length and she cut it shorter in the front and longer in the back she also used a pair of very dull pair of scissors I get home to find that she missed quite a few pieces of hair lied to me about one price and then tried to charge me more than what I had been told she also cut the back of my neck quite a few times with the electrical shaver thing made me bleed little tiny cuts but still painful also at the beginning when she washed my hair she used scolding hot water on my hair when she washed it I had told her more than once that it was hot but she just kept on mumbling talking over me not even listening to me completely disgusted I still tipped her tho cus Im not a mean person but now that i see my hair the next day to be 3 different lengths a DO NOT GO TO THIS SALON !!! The owner reached out to me thought they would do the right thing and give me a refund after having my hair butchered with a dull pair of scissors after 2 days of pointless phone calls and still not being listened to about WHAT I WANTED they wouldnt even do the honorable thing and give me my money back Wish I could give zero stars  very disgusted with this treatment who would want to go back to the people that ruined their hair ?,1,15:07.3

The Hair Boutique - Hair Salon Ottawa,"Update - Ive changed my review to 5 stars. The owner emailed me after I posted my review to see what could be done to make my experience better. He then invited me to come in the next day (today) and he worked with me to give me a cut I liked. He shaped my hair while dry and wildly curly, washed then went over it again. The shaping he did really made a dofferdiff and I like the cut much more now. Its still very short but that can only be fixed with time. I felt so bad leaving the previous review but he didnt make me feel bad about it at all, told me I did the right thing. I will go back again. -------- I got a hair cut here yesterday and I hate it. Ive never hated a hair cut before .The girl was very nice but she didnt do at all what I wanted. I cried myself to sleep last night. Its way to short and it is incredibly unflattering for my face.

The Hair Boutique - Hair Salon Ottawa,"Horrible!! Booked an appointment based upon a convo with a stylist about matching my roots To the colour of my ends. I was to have my roots lighten then a toner. I mentioned that although i prefer being another shade of blond normally I can deal with this plan  because I have an interview coming up. Went in the next day for my appointment - the girl did 3 Toners which did nothing but make my look worse and like a glow worm - the roots needed to be lightened before toning. I was in tears because of this shade. The girl I saw was telling me that I need to gain more confidence and just let my hair be.im sorry but she doesn t have to deal with this . I didn t want to pay but she said she would call the police. Finally the next day , the manager called me and wanted me to come in and sit with him - I don t have time and do not want service at this place what so ever. I want my money back. He said it would take up to 2 weeks to process a cheque - why can t I just go tomorrow and deal with it? According to him - since I work in law  why can t I wait and why do I need the money back. Very rude. However as he claimed in the phone he will give me my money back tomorrow  so he doesn t have to deal with me anymore .... very professional business practice I must say. I will update how this plays out because regardless my profession I should not be treated as such and my money should be returned with an apology",1,15:09.6

Spring Hair Studio,Ive grown my hair out through the pandemic and instead of going for a trip every three weeks like I used to do Ive sought to shape my longer hair with mixed success with other stylists. Ive been very happy with Azams cuts twice now. Location downtown near the O-Train. Also she offers a touch-up within a week if youre not happy with the result.,5,15:15.4

Spring Hair Studio,"Went to get a wash, cut and style for the first time in quite a while and Im so happy with the result! My hair was very long and I wasnt sure how to style it, but Azam had me covered. She suggested layers and bangs and showed me how theyd be flattering for the way I wear my hair. Azam double-checked with me before cutting the different lengths and was eager to make me happy but also very confident in her work, and the result was great. Im very happy with both price and service and plan to visit again in the future!",5,15:15.4
Spring Hair Studio,Azam is an incredibly kind and loving person who truly puts her best efforts into every client she takes on. She is definitely the only stylist I trust with my curly hair. Prices here are very affordable given the location.,5,15:15.4

Sunday Hair Cut + Colour Club,"I have amazing things to say about each staff here! First of all, Savanna and Rowan have created such a cool, personalized, laid back, attentive, and non-pretentious shop! Sav is great with blondes, textured cuts and always has time to make you feel like a million bucks, she really cares and pours her heart into her clients. Rowan is an amazing barber, he s cut my husband s hair for years. He s quick, efficient, has an eye for what looks good and is so personable. Leslie is equally talented, great with colour (esp blondes) and cuts. Tay recently cut my son s hair and wow was she ever great with this kid. Listened to all his stories (Minecraft, Pokemon, the whole lot) and did a great curly cut on a ten year old. Love this shop, love the owners, love the staff. Sunday forever.",5,15:16.0

Sunday Hair Cut + Colour Club,,5,15:16.0
Sunday Hair Cut + Colour Club,"Have been coming here for a while to get my haircut from Tay and I am impressed with the quality of my haircut everytime I go. The space itself is very clean and has a really wonderful vibe, I really like the decor and how the space comes together. I also enjoy that the space is a bit split up in the sense that they have the hair salon at one section of the shop and the haircutting in another. I recommend this spot for anyone looking for a solid fade or a wonderful women s cut. Will definitely be coming back",5,15:16.0
Sunday Hair Cut + Colour Club,"Friendly, attentive and professional staff. Each time I go is a great experience, would definitely recommend!",5,15:16.0

Sunday Hair Cut + Colour Club,"Leslie did my bridal hair for me and did such an amazing job! I have thin hair and was worried the style I wanted would be a challenge, but she made it look perfect. She was so chill and efficient and made the whole experience so much less stressful. My bun lasted through photos in the pouring rain and hours of dancing. Leslie s the best!",5,15:16.0
Sunday Hair Cut + Colour Club,Savanna is amazing! She is a truly talented hairstylist. I always love what she does with my hair both colour and cut! Highly recommend her and everyone at the Salon.,5,15:16.0
Sunday Hair Cut + Colour Club,"I have been very satisfied with the haircut by Taylor. I heard they joined Sunday earlier this year. Taylors design exceeded my expectations; they are the best barber Ive had when it comes to a shorter hairstyle. The final haircut makes my head look smaller and my face look angular, which contributed to a more masculine and mature look; however, the overall shape of my head is still streamlined. Im certain that Taylor will be loved by more clients here.",5,15:16.5
Sunday Hair Cut + Colour Club,Savanna is a master at what she does! Always love getting my hair cut and coloured in the beautiful atmosphere the owners have created.,5,15:16.5

Sunday Hair Cut + Colour Club,"Leslie does such a great job! I had been so hesitant to get my hair cut for years due to some previous poor experiences, but she always takes the time to do a proper consultation and never takes off too much length. Very talented at balayage and modern techniques. I have been working towards growing out my hair from a short bob and she has given me beautiful cuts  each time while still letting it grow out. Its also the little things like showing me how to style my hair. My hair has never been healthier.",5,15:16.5
Sunday Hair Cut + Colour Club,Been going here about a year and Rowan is the best in the business. Super friendly staff that make you feel comfortable right away. I will definitely continue to go here for years to come. Highly recommend to anyone!,5,15:16.5

From the moment I walked in, the staff were friendly and welcoming, creating a vibe of positivity and warmth that made me feel right at home. The decor is not only modern, laid-back and stylish, but it exudes a sense of coolness and relaxation while also being uplifting and vibrant. The staff here are awesome. Leslie, who did my hair, was amazing to work with. She s very knowledgeable, skilled and passionate about her craft. She listened carefully to what I wanted. She took the time to understand my needs and preferences and was patient and attentive throughout the entire process. It s clear that she genuinely cares about her clients. I opted for a full balayage and root melt and I was truly blown away by the results. I ve been to many salons in Ottawa and I haven t ever been this happy with my hair! Overall, the service at this salon is top-notch and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a truly exceptional experience.",5,15:16.5

In all seriousness, I ve been a client of Savanna s for over 5 years. It was love at first cut, colour, and style. Savanna is incredibly talented   a true expert and master of her craft.

Saab Salon Spa,"This was the quickest haircut experience I have ever had. I got my hair cut, blow dried, and styled by Frank. I have lots of thick, dark, curly, and virgin hair, meaning that I require lots of layering. Frank worked his magic, and left me feeling brand new. I got so many compliments in my hair, and I ve never been in and out of a salon that fast. I will definitely be returning.",5,15:18.8

Saab Salon Spa,"Jordan did an amazing job with my caramel balayage in my dark brown hair a few weeks before my wedding, it looked super nice and natural and the color is still intact. I returned to SAAB for my wedding day hair & makeup with my mom and sister, Jordan and staff did an incredible job with all of our hair and makeup. My updo stayed intact for the rest of the day (including a photoshoot in Gatineau park with some wind and snow!), and my makeup was subtle and natural-looking, which is exactly what I wanted. Thank you to Jordan and staff and apologies for my borderline panic attack moment near the end of the appointment when I thought we would be late to the ceremony haha. I will definitely be returning to SAAB!",5,15:18.9
Saab Salon Spa,"Amazing staff, beautiful atmosphere, warm welcome, professional, and most importantly, stellar work.",5,15:18.9
Saab Salon Spa,Frank and Jordan always do a great job and always seem to have the time to fit in my mens cut when I need one. I also really appreciate the head/neck massage and hair wash that seems to be part of the process at Saab. Go for the peppermint oil when asked. :),5,15:18.9

Saab Salon Spa,"I went to get my hair done for my brother s wedding. The staff were very nice and friendly. I requested a wash, blow dry and curl with a curling iron, my booking request was very specific. The issue is the stylist who did my hair, unfortunately does not know how to blow dry hair using a brush, so she ended up blow drying my hair looking very frizzy. Then for curling, she decided to use a flat iron instead of a curling iron, which is fine if you just want some quick curls to go at home. But you would expect the real thing at the salon. Unfortunately, my hair didn t even last for a couple of hours then turned into a big frizz thing that looked awful, not to mention it was so stiff from all the hair spray she sprayed on which was really unnecessary. The wedding guests even asked who did my hair, so they don t go there,  it was just ridiculously bad. When you go to a nice salon like that and pay the price, you expect the stylists to be well trained and actually be able to blow dry hair properly. The skill level is unfortunately pathetic! I didn t want to embrace the stylist, because she was nice but I will never go back again. Service: Hairstyling",2,15:19.4
Saab Salon Spa,"great environment, experience, and results!!",5,15:19.4
Saab Salon Spa,"Probably the worst and most expensive salon experience ever. From the receptionist to Frank, to the manager - all terrible and so, so rude. How can using product fix my UNEVEN hair? Yes. Uneven. As in one side is LONGER than the other. Yes, the manager told me to use product to fix this my hair being longer one side than the other. And no, I dont want him to fix it I just want my money back. But nooo refund, I can have a credit. A credit for what? So I can have something else ruined. No thanks. Saab Salon is terrible. They are rude and discriminate based on their interpretation of social class. I should have went to first choice - at least ruined hair would not have cost so much. BTW, you never know who people know, and how bad your actual business reputation around town is...Ive hear things about them....at the BIA and elsewhere. Good luck crooks.",1,15:19.4

Saab Salon Spa,"Been going for years. Very nice people. Do well with all kinds of hair. Have a small cafe for guests, sometimes Smarties. Not for barbering, that I know of, but do offer mustache waxing as part of their spa treatment. Have booster seats if you need them, will double check that everything is good pressure- and temperature-wise for the shampoo & scalp massage. Dont try to upsell, but will provide recommendations if asked. Small talk, familiar attitude, fairly expensive, but worth the price. Theyve got a full store if youre just looking for products as well.",5,15:20.5
Saab Salon Spa,Saab salon is a fantastic place to go and get pampered. They have incredible staff and everyone is so warm and welcoming.

Everyone at the front desk as kind and caring, while also offering me beverages and coffee while awaiting my hairstylist. The environment was clean and professional throughout my hair appointment with Jordan. The entire Saab team is amazing and filled with the most talented and skilled hairstylists. By far one of the best salons in Ottawa!",5,15:20.5
Saab Salon Spa,Jordan and the Saab Salon team s work has been nothing short of impeccable over the 8 years I have dealt with them. Any spam coming from so-called  clients  who have never even been to the Salon should be discredited for trying to falsify information and smear the name of this established small business,5,15:20.5

Saab Salon Spa,Super friendly and professional environment. Honestly ever since I came across this salon I have not cut my hair anywhere else. Frank makes sure to go out of his way to welcome me every time I go. You can tell they care for their customers. I would highly recommend! Jordan is my usual hair stylist. Very knowledgeable. They also carry Aveda huge bonus for me.. 10/10.,5,15:20.5
Saab Salon Spa,"Kindest and most welcoming hairstylists you can come across! Been going to Saab Salon now for over 15 years and the standard remains unbeatable.

I highly suggest checking out this high end and modern feel salon for any beauty care needs.",5,15:20.5
Saab Salon Spa,"Don t go to this hair salon. They ruined my girlfriends hair, and the lack of communication on their part is very poor.",1,15:21.1
Saab Salon Spa,"I ve been a customer here for years and while the spa like services are top notch  over the years the hair services for the price has in the last three visits has left me feeling less than satisfied. Three times over the years I ve had hair dye services in which the last service has finally turned me to look for a new hair salon. My second hair dye I had asked for maroon red, and they had dyed my hair orange. When I asked them to redo it - you could tell they were frustrated but they did it. I went in for my first balayage on my third dye experience and last appointment I had wanted bright silver as my main colour to transition. Being blonde I was told by friends who had had this done by their stylists- that this should be relatively easy in comparison to darker hair. The stylist at the time with SAAB when I asked for this said  No - that simply won t suit your skin colour. It will blanch you. Better to have it as blonde especially as a first balayage. You ll look better with it.  Honestly I wasn t sure what to say as I had never had one done and she was the expert, but given the price I paid for the service and other hair dye services with similar experiences  I realized that I needed to find a new salon for myself. I mean don t get me wrong the balayage is beautiful but it s super light and barely noticeable even with proper care of cooler water and hair protection shampoos. I think this is also a lesson in standing up for what you want regardless on what the hairstylist says  but you should be in an establishment that supports your vision while still making suggestions and confirming with you. Again I won t diminish the whole place as it is excellent with their spa services  and they cut hair wonderfully  but unless you demand for what you want and are your own expert in hair colour and dye - I personally would look elsewhere for colouring.

She s an expert with thick hair and I m honestly so in love with my hair now more than I ve ever been. Her technique is amazing, she knows how to create shape and face framing, she thins it with dimension and precision and knows exactly what she s doing. She s very skilled. And she s FAST.

Rise Hair Team,"I went to this salon for a consultation and was excused after a two-three minute conversion with one of the stylists. I felt completely disrespected and disregarded as if it was my own fault for my natural hair. I 100% understand if an artist is not comfortable with doing something, however the approach to decline was completely disappointing from a (potential) client perspective. I never write Google Reviews, yet feel this needed to be addressed as this is due to unprofessional work attitude shown a this salon by a particular stylist. I am unaware of the stylist s name as it was not made apparent. I am not trying to put a negative review for the fun of it, however, perhaps can bring this to the attention of the salon s management to ensure there clients are being treated with respect during there time at the salon.",1,15:21.6

Rise Hair Team,"Natalie and Anne did a great job for my wedding photoshoot. Unfortunately, I have to give a one-star as the girl who was my washing hair asked me if my sister-in-law & husband were Canadian. She clearly meant if they were white. And outright asked me my background coz my skin colour isnt white. I have never been this offended. No other white customer was asked this question. She claimed that being coloured its fine to ask ppl their backgrounds as she wants to learn about different cultures. Well, whites arent exactly cultureless. Its just a colonial mentality to ask non-white ppl their background as they will never be Canadian enough. I am the 3/4th generation here. Shame!",1,15:22.3

Rise Hair Team,"After having two kids during a pandemic my hair needed a serious refresh, I wanted a new style and to brighten up the colour (and make my greys less obvious!) but I was a little hesitant to commit to a big change. Brianna took the time to talk through exactly what I was looking for, discuss inspiration pictures, and figure out what was best for me and my lifestyle. I m so happy with what she did and have complete trust in her! The salon is in a great location with parking, and so cute with tons of natural light and fresh decor. I wish I didn t wait so long to take the leap and can t wait to go back again!",5,15:22.3
Rise Hair Team,Great haircut. Awesome customer service. Super helpful.,5,15:22.3
Rise Hair Team,Started going there to see Nadia for my highlights 3 years ago and been loyal ever since. She is the best and works very quickly. Whole staff is amazing!,5,15:22.3

Rise Hair Team,"Nadia, Pedro and the entire team do a fantastic job on my curly hair. The color and cut are great and the team is very professional and welcoming. I always look forward to my appointment!",5,15:22.9
Rise Hair Team,Rise is the best salon I have been to in Ottawa! I have been seeing Nadia and Jen for a few years and will keep going back. They are so kind and I trust them completely with my hair.,5,15:22.9
Rise Hair Team,"Rise Hair Team is by far the best hair studio that I have ever gone to. The reason for this is that the staff are kind, compassionate, professional, hard working and their hair products are superior quality. Their pricing is fair for the quality and service. I am very pleased with my hair cut and colour ever time I go there and the staff are knowledgeable and aim to please their customers. I highly recommend Rise Hair team, you will be more than delighted with the excellent work that they do!",5,15:22.9
Rise Hair Team,"Ive been going to Nadia, the owner of Rise, for my colour for many years. Shes superb - the best colourist Ive ever had. Anh, my stylist, completes the picture by cutting and styling my hair flawlessly, every time. I get compliments on my hair all the time, and its all due to the talents of these two exceptional professionals. Not only are they wonderful at their jobs, theyre both lovely people, as is the entire staff. Anyone who visits Rise is welcomed and treated as a valued friend, not just a customer. Id encourage anyone to visit this salon. Services: Hairstyling , Hair coloring",5,15:22.9
Rise Hair Team,"Everyone knows how difficult it is to find a good hair stylist or to change in case you move to live to another city. For the past 5 years, my wife and I are very happy we have found Nadia and Anh, both very nice and professional women who care about their clients and do everything to make as feel wonderful each time were visiting the salon. It doesnt matter what is the name of the salon or how many times it changed its name. The most important thing is the people who work there and are very committed to give their clients the best possible service and a personal care.",5,15:22.9
Rise Hair Team,"To respond to the previous individual who asked why the business name changes; the salon name has changed (only once) since having been opened because of changes in the business structure :) This is the best salon in Ottawa. I have been seeing the owner (Nadia) at previous salons before she stepped out on her own starting Rise Hair Team for over 10 years for my colour. I work in the public sector and have daily (very heavy) interaction with the traveling public; I get compliments on my hair every single day. Men even notice my hair saying their wives have been trying to achieve a similar colour/style with no luck, and if *that* is not an indication of the level of quality of the service afforded ar this salon then I dont know what to tell you! The stylists at Rise (I have extensive personal experience with Nadia, Jen, Ang, and Natalie) will always go above and beyond to help you achieve your hair goals. They are knowledgeable professionals who know exactly how to get you the look you want, how to tackle hair nightmares, and will also impart their knowledge on you so you can take keep taking care of your hair after heading home. Bonuses worthy of a side note are: there is free parking on-site, they are located centrally downtown, and they use Kevin Murphy products. Not enough time to say enough great things.",5,15:23.4
Rise Hair Team,"Jen is an absolute magician. I was looking for a retro, Hollywood glam hairstyle for my wedding and did she ever deliver! My hair was gorgeous and stayed pristine all day, which is very difficult to do with asian hair. She did lots of research and really nailed the look! Jen also did the hair for my bridal party and mother of the bride. They all had wonderful experiences and she adapted their inspo photos to their hair type and overall look. Jen is fun, professional, and SO INCREDIBLE at what she does! Not to mention that she was running ahead of schedule! What a dream stylist to work with. As a certified wedding planner, I will definitely send my future brides her way.",5,15:23.5

Royal Hair Ottawa,"Initially I did not have the right hair so the hairstylist was kind to rebook me in early to another day s appointment. Sadly despite this, I did not end up with the result I wanted. I wanted a short blunt bob and I showed many pictures of the look I was going for. After over 5 hours, I ended up with a shapeless weave. She was unable to fix it due to the hair I had being  too thin  on the ends. Very disappointed with the end result.",1,15:23.8

Royal Hair Ottawa,"A very friendly stylist did my dreads (interlock method). But have a lot of hair - I went in advance to get an estimate in person, but it still took twice as long as they initially said (they assured me repeatedly it would take 2 hours). It would have been nice to get an hourly price. Also wasnt super neat. Ive been getting my dreads done for 8+ years and I also usually get dreads trimmed and braided/styled...but that was not included here.",4,15:24.9

Royal Hair Ottawa,"Listen, its been three weeks and my hair is still looking day-one fresh and neat. Im not going to lie, these passion twists have me acting up a little. Seriously, these ladies are great at what they do. Theres a sense of community and sisterhood in that room: lots of laughs and just feeling comfortable. Theyre super gentle with your scalp, no need for Tylenol or sleeping at a 90 degree angle. You cant find better hours elsewhere and they have a great booking/reservation system! Unfortunately for them, they will be seeing my yapper self again. Thanks again, and I wish you guys all the best this year.",5,15:24.9

They proceeded to leave his messages on seen, not answer their work phone, or check the door for him. He was left outside waiting for 45 minutes before being seen. Now, the business is still telling me it is his fault as he was late, when he was not. Beyond disappointing for a business to not take accountability for ignoring texts and phone calls and not checking the front door, and instead insist he was late. Horrendous business.",1,15:25.6

The Connoisseur Art and Hair Studio,"He did a nice job but I feel ripped off. The website says 38 and up for a womans haircut. Mine was 85, when I only asked for a simple trim. If its over twice the starting price, it should be made more clear on their website.",1,15:32.4

The Connoisseur Art and Hair Studio,"This has to be the worst salon one has to ever visit . This person has no idea about what he is doing . I went here for a layer cut and bangs. He did cut an inch from overall length and blow dried the hair . When I constantly explained him , he just kept saying that looks good n healthy Place is all dirty , he doesn t use proper hygiene techniques. After he cuts the hair , he won t even sweep the hair of floor so we don t walk on the mess. He washed my hair and seated me at drying chair and he started cutting a man s hair then he blow dried , all the hair pieces of that person were on me coz of the air . He even charges you more than the listed prices If you don t want to be robbed or if you don t want to get any disease from all that unhygienic area. Strictly avoid this place",1,15:32.4

The Connoisseur Art and Hair Studio,"Haircut was ok after I directed him to cut more. The floor was a mess and covered in hair. It was disgusting. I was the only one in the shop and he did not have clients when I walked in. He was painting. The sign says $17, but he charged me $26. I paid it without complaint. He only takes cash, which I think is fishy. Hes a very nice guy, but I wont go back. Update: I have reported him to the tax authorities, because he didnt accept cards, and only accepts cash.",2,15:32.4

Red Salon,"Love love love them!  Especially Shannon I tend to have long, thick, tangly, overtreated and wild yak-like hair.  (The overtreated part is my fault). Anyhow, I went to see Shannon for a full highlight in an attempt to go blonder (which Ive been told in the past would be hard/impossible to achieve without irreparably damaging my Yak hair) But Shannon did  it up and my hair is BEAUTIFUL!  She really took her time, made me feel really safe and well taken care of.  And my hair feels healthier than it did before i went in.  I am SO HAPPY.  I Cannot say enough about these ladies.  And they are really nice people.  Well priced, clean and beautiful salon.  LOVE THEM",5,15:36.5

I have a hard time with buisy places, and as soon as i came in they welcomed me and i felt very at home. From the beautiful young lady that washed my hair  which was amazing to the friendliest atmosphere ever, i have NEVER had such a great experience.  I am now a beautiful woman, thanks to you and your wonderful company.  Many returns and recommendations.  I will be back, and back and again,  ( you get the point ) THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH.",5,15:36.5

Red Salon,"PLEASE WATCH OUT! Over $200 for an unfixable mistake! My friends and husband are absolutely shocked at how badly my hair was done by Ariel at Red Salon. I went in for some subtle babylights on my medium/dark blonde hair and a trim. It didnt turn out subtle, but instead dark brown with high contrast white/blonde streaks. She tried to fix it after the owner noticed that something was wrong, but it just made parts of my hair red (making it now incredibly hard to fix it).  It ended up being 3-4 full shades darker than my natural roots, while the streaks went brassy yellow, verging on white.When I got home I realized that Ariel had CHARGED me for the products to fix her massive mistake. It was over $200. The hair cut itself is jagged, uneven, and poorly blended. Its simply the worst hair cut Ive ever had. I dont want any other woman out there to have to be submitted to the same experience as me, so please be careful.",1,15:37.0
Red Salon,"This place is good if you have caucasian hair or you dont want any colour too out of the ordinary. The first time I went here I wanted to go from black hair to blonde. Which I know is a difficult task and I give full appreciation to the hairdresser who tried her hardest. It came out very ginger. I wanted one colour blonde and got highlights. After a couple of months I came back thinking I would get it lighter (because thats what the stylist told me) and to the blonde I wanted. Unfortunately, it was the same result except this time my roots were a bit darker than before so the colour had a pretty harsh line and the same price for a fraction of the hair length. After a year, I came in wanting to go even lighter and literally came out the darkest Ive ever gone since getting it done. The bottom part literally has black streaks and the colour on my roots are nearly black as well (she gave me roots when thats the last thing I wanted) There are orange strands, a little bit of blonde, dark brown, light brown and dark grey. It is just a mess. The hairdresser even had to redye it again because it came out so dark so I was there for more than 5 hours. It is so far from what I wanted, I wish they would have told me that they couldnt do it instead of me paying nearly 300 for a good haircut.",2,15:37.0
Red Salon,"My experience at Red Salon has always been relaxing, comfortable and efficient.  I have had the luck of finding my haven for hair and nails in one place! Shannon has been doing my nails and waxing for the past year and i wouldnt go anywhere else, does an amazing job everytime- not just saying that, she even focuses on that side nail which often gets missed, and has a great color selection.  Very beautiful person, its like im visiting a good friend- always ensures im comfortable. Carolyn has been my hairs savior for a while now, took me a while to find someone who is comfortable with long hair like mine.  Not only does she do a perfect cut and color... My bangs have always been my challenge.  I find most hair salons will cut my bangs without a thought of how they grow out.  I used to get my bangs cut every 2 weeks, now its every month because of her thoughtfullness of the cut. I usually dont take the time to write reviews but i think everyone should feel the way they make you feel.  We all need this time to get away and pamper ourselves, this is my escape... Hopefully see you there!",5,15:37.0
Red Salon,Carolyn has been my hairstylist for over 10 years and I have never been unhappy with my colour and cut. I always get compliments on how nice my hair looks. Carolyn is excellent for choosing the right colour and style to suit. Highly recommend Red Salon and Spa.,5,15:37.0
Red Salon,,5,15:37.0
Red Salon,Carolyn gave me a fabulous haircut! This is my first time going there after having my hair done by another stylist for almost 20 years. She took time to talk to me about what I was looking for and gave me the haircut I wanted and that looks really good. It is easy to take care of and I am really pleased with how the hair looks all day long. Carolyn is a very knowledgeable and skilled stylist. The lady who greeted me and washed my hair was very friendly and give the best scalp massage ever. I hope this is a new beginning of a very long hair relationship.,5,15:37.0

Reflections Hair Salon,"The consultation to discuss the haircut felt rushed and the haircut took less than 15 mins. The styling part was the most bizarre (there was none). The stylist slapped some product on my hair while it was still damp,  did not blow dry it and sent me out the door. Ive never had this kind of a salon experience and it was underwhelming. Is this the norm in most Salons?",2,15:41.9

Reflections Hair Salon,"Last September, I visited this salon to get a perm, as my wedding was fast approaching. Right from the start, I was warmly greeted by Rob, who not only did my hair but also ensured that I was comfortable throughout the process. What made the experience even more delightful were the engaging conversations I had with Rob   a truly kind soul :-) The staff there are incredibly friendly, creating a welcoming and professional environment. Now, lets talk about the results: my hair looked absolutely stunning! Rob did an amazing job, and its evident in the skill and care he puts into his work. Here we are in January, I lost track of time post wedding and honey moon, but writing this review has been on the back of my mind throughout :-) Im writing this review with a heart full of gratitude. I deeply appreciate Rob and the team for their exceptional service. My wedding hair was a resounding success. I highly recommend this salon to anyone looking for top-notch hair care and a genuinely pleasant experience.",5,15:41.9

Showpony offers exceptional customer service and are very flexible. I was out of town and they truly tried to accommodate me for my trial and scheduled me months ahead of time which usually isnt the custom. They also accommodated some crucial last minute changes the day before the wedding. They go above and beyond for their clients. Emily, their wedding coordinator, is very organized, kind and responds quickly. The showpony team truly wants whats best for their bride. They both listened and offered advice on the optimal hairstyle for the wedding day. Laurie is truly exceptionally at styling for Hollywood hair.

For the wedding day itself, I went to the salon and Shelby was able to help me find the perfect colour match for extension rentals. On the day, Lori did my hair, my MILs, my moms, and my MOHs.

His facials are not just about your skin looking good, but also about your whole body, and his upper body massages while the masks are on your face are just incredible! Besides top notch facials, his incredible knowledge on skin products has allowed me to really tune in to my skins needs based on the season, my stress levels or just my budget! He never pushes products on you and truly cares about your skin glowing. Perhaps more importantly, he is lovely to work with, and going to my facials always feel like I am about to visit a great friend. I highly recommend Brian!",5,15:45.3

Le Petit Salon,"I had an appointment with Kirby. I show up on time, took an hour off from work, when I arrived a girl asked me to wait and that Kirby will be with you in a moment. After waiting for 20 minutes I walked up to reception and asked if she s going to show up. I was informed that my appointment was cancelled an hour ago and they had sent me a text and an email. I showed them my phone there was no text, I checked my email after leaving the salon, no email. They had my correct contact details  but somehow magically I didn t receive any notification. My appointment was said to be cancelled an hour ahead of the scheduled time. I was very disappointed and felt like waste of my time calling to book and showing up for the appointment. I don t support the businesses that don t value others  time. And after looking at the reviews it seems like a habit of them  to over book and then cancel last minute and don t even have a decent reason or apology for doing so.",1,15:49.4
Le Petit Salon,"Vanessa gave me my dream hair!  I came in with a picture as my  goal  hair, knowing that it may not be possible based on the  colour of my hair naturally, or the condition of it.  I was so thrilled when she said it was achievable.  Before completely drying my hair she checked in with me to make sure I was happy with the tone (I was), and was one of the first stylists I felt like actually listened to me for what I wanted for my hair cut. The salon itself is also stunning. Overall as a first time visit, I m super impressed and will return for years to come!",5,15:49.4

Le Petit Salon,"I have been a client of LPS since 2016, and seeing Jessica for many years - shes a really experienced stylist who takes the time to understand my hair, and has always made me feel listened to. When she had to cancel my appointment at the last minute for terrible, but understandable, circumstances, the salon was unable to provide any sort of accommodation that matched her experience. When I asked for other options, the manager personally insulted me and threatened me if I wrote a negative review because she was the manager. She seems inexperienced and defensive. I will not be giving LPS my money or business any more. Edit: The only response I have to the establishment s own response is that the owner kept on bringing up the personal situation of the hairstylist in question, presumably to make me feel bad for requesting accommodations that, as the owner notes, were fair of me to refuse. Honestly, it s all very shameful. I will not be giving this business any time or money. Having experienced a situation like my hairstylist and then having it basically weaponized against me was triggering and offensive. Shame on them.",1,15:50.0

I have a lot of hair and she is so patient and truly amazing at her craft. I had Adina as my hair washer this last time and she was FANTASTIC. She gave the best massage, was so kind and wonderful. As I watched her while I waited for my hair  to be finished she was so proactive, efficient and always taking initiative. People like Adina make a shop like LPS run smoothly and should be recognized. Wonderful experience",5,15:50.0

Le Petit Salon,This is the worse place that someone can waste his/her money in town First Look how unprofessional this place is.. They called my wife to cancel an appointment she had booked for family pictures months in advance just one hour before the appointment... saying that the hairstylist was sick and she wasnt able to make it for the appointment After my wife insisted that the appointment was important and she needed the haircut They said ..oh we gonna call her in just for you When my wife went as a surprise the hairstylist was feeling perfectly fine  just she was overbooked and she forgot about the lie .. Because she was in so much rush she gived to my wife her worse haircut and not what my wife  wanted After the haircut my wife asked to buy some products that still the rude hairstylist said no we dont have  it ... My advice for everyone of you Stay away from this unprofessional and rude place,1,15:50.7

Salon SiBelle Ottawa,I love my hair so much thank you    Dj is so good,5,15:53.2
Salon SiBelle Ottawa,"Since I came to this city in 2014, Ive always had my hair cut by Dino. His skilled hands and deep understanding of trendy hairstyles have always left me more than satisfied. Especially memorable was a transparent hair wax he once stocked strong and lasting, it was unforgettable lol. Even though he no longer carries that product, Ive continued to choose him for his unmatched skill and insight into fashionable hairstyles. Despite moving to Toronto for work in 2019 and being away from ottawa, I always make it a point to get my hair done by Dino whenever I have the chance to return. Reuniting and catching up with him after years feels just right. Dino is not only excellent in his craft but also a wonderful person. I would also like to say sorry to DJ, the hairstylist, as I hadn t visited this salon in a few years. Being in Toronto, I wasn t aware that they had implemented a booking system and added another hairstylist. I called to make an appointment as I used to, without realizing I had actually booked with another stylist, DJ, until I arrived and was about to get my haircut. Even though DJ was understanding and Dino ended up cutting my hair, I still feel quite embarrassed about the mix-up.",5,15:53.2
Salon SiBelle Ottawa,"Not only did I leave the salon feeling fabulous, but I also received compliments on my new hairstyle from friends and colleagues. The attention to detail and commitment to customer satisfaction truly set DJ apart. I highly recommend DJ to anyone seeking a top-notch haircare experience. I will definitely be returning for all my future hair needs.",5,15:53.2
Salon SiBelle Ottawa,"I decided to try Salon SiBelle after complimenting my friend on her great hair cut. This trendy little salon must be the best kept secret right here in my neighbourhood.  So far, two great haircuts by Dino, both quite different styles.  I brought in photos both times and got EXACTLY what I asked for....  No need to go home and fix it as Ive often done in the past. I look forward to more great cuts and styles with Dino - he is a professional stylist and perfectionist.  I couldnt be more happy with his work.  Five stars for Dino...",5,15:53.2

Salon SiBelle Ottawa,"I do not recommend this salon, not at all....I got the haircut from DJ and he doesnt know much about the styles he cut the whole hair from the left back side.

Salon SiBelle Ottawa,"This placed used to be the place to go but I find the owner Dino to be quite bad at customer service. I had booked an appointment but apparently according to Dino I didn t go through the last step to finalize the appointment - whether this is true or not there is a nice way to approach a customer when saying this. Instead of being polite he proceeds to tell me that he pays 100s of dollars on a system that Costco pays millions for and it s flawless - newsflash buddy no technology is ever flawless we see it all the time so right when that comment was made it put me off to the guy and the whole business. I just needed a quick touch up of a haircut and if he didn t have time that s fine, but being nicer to your customers isn t that hard. I was coming from the other side of town and he wasn t willing to make any exceptions - he didn t seem to want to help anyways. I will be taking my business elsewhere. I ve already found a new establishment that does great haircuts and perms on Robertson and I will be taking my business there from now on.",1,15:54.4

Layers Hair Design,"I contacted Layer Hair Design for the first time to book an appointment, but I was quite surprised by their response. They informed me that they are fully booked until mid-June and that they take appointments six weeks in advance. This type of marketing seems to aim at impressing customers with the high demand for their services. However, this approach has become outdated and is no longer believable to customers. As a result, I decided to look elsewhere for my hair care needs. My advice to them is that this marketing strategy is ineffective because customers are savvy and do not fall for such tactics.",1,15:58.5
Layers Hair Design,I went for the scalp detox and it was amazing!. It was very relaxing and just what I needed. Hiba was so friendly and kind. I highly recommend everyone get this done! You will not be disappointed.,5,15:58.5
Layers Hair Design,100% recommend it to anyone that wants a little bit of pampering and help with achieving a healthier scalp. Hiba was so friendly and warm from the moment we walked in. My husband had booked the Japanese Scalp Detox session as an anniversary gift and Hiba was very sweet and accommodating even though she was fully booked. She even gave a complimentary styling as it was my wedding anniversary and that was very much appreciated. Will surely be returning to this salon for other future salon services!,5,15:58.5
Layers Hair Design,The Japanese scalp detox (head spa) was one of best experiences I have had.  All the tension you have in your body goes away.  You can literally feel the tension leave your body.  It may not be a full body message but it may as well be one.  Hibas technique adds that much more to the process.  She makes you feel very comfortable and relaxed before you even start and after as well.  I would recommend this to everyone.  Thank you Hiba for and fantastic experience.,5,15:58.5

I ve suffered from psoriasis for years, but it s gotta so bad this past year that I wouldn t leave the house without just having a shower and wearing some sort of hat.

I cried happy tears when I got to feel the clean skin on my scalp for the first time in over a year. I highly recommend this treatment for anyone with a scalp condition, it s a great price and one of the very few places in Ottawa that offer this treatment. Thank you so much!",5,15:59.1

While being a client of hers, she educated me on what I can do to benefit my hair and how to style it. Hiba also prioritized what is best for my hair. I really appreciated that and when I come to visit Ottawa, I will definitely book an appointment to see her. When I was getting my hair colour lifted, she stopped where she felt my hair was safe and healthy. Skills and experience do the talking for her! I highly recommend booking an appointment with her.

HAIR REPUBLIC | OTTAWA SALONS,"I ran to Hair republic a few days before a trip with long hair that was half natural and half black box dye. I went to the Bank street location and they managed to squeeze me in last minute booked with Nour. He did the impossible, he did a balayage on me and the results were shocking. Perfectly lightened the black and blended it into my natural roots!!! If you are in a sticky situation with your hair possibly even last minute like me, 100% go visit Nour at the Hair Republic on Bank street!!!!!!!",5,16:05.5
HAIR REPUBLIC | OTTAWA SALONS,I came in with very dark hair and wanted a subtle balayage that would give some dimension to my curly hair.

I ve gotten so many compliments! Stylist: Fatema Habib,5,16:05.5
HAIR REPUBLIC | OTTAWA SALONS,"Horrible experience. I got a haircut from Ho-Fung Cheung. First of all, there was a communication problem; he couldn t understand most of what I was saying. I asked for curtain bangs and explained it well, but he cut them unevenly. When I asked him about it, he was rude and said, This is my style and how I do things. Afterwards, he started applying a thick curl serum to my hair without asking or informing me. When I asked him what and why he was applying it, he said he was styling it. I tried to stop him, but he didn t and rudely told me not to touch my hair for a while. I was so intimidated by him. Since that day, my hair has been greasy and uneven. This is the worst haircut experience I ve ever had and it was honestly traumatic. My friend had a similar experience here with another hairdresser Sadete Rexhepaj. Chatters Marketplace is way better. Please find any hair salon other than this if you don t want to be disappointed.",1,16:05.5

Looking forward to going back!",5,16:05.5

HAIR REPUBLIC | OTTAWA SALONS,"I recently had the pleasure of getting my hair colored and cut by Fatema, and I couldnt be happier with the results. As someone who has had their fair share of disappointing experiences with hairstylists in the past, I was a bit nervous trying someone new. However, Fatemas expertise and attention to detail quickly put me at ease. Not only did she listen carefully to what I wanted, but she also offered valuable advice and suggestions based on my hair type and preferences. The end result was beyond my expectations   my hair looks vibrant, healthy, and exactly how I envisioned it.

HAIR REPUBLIC | OTTAWA SALONS,"I recently had my hair cut into a short bob (the shortest its been!) by Fatema, and loved the results!  Fatema was patient and consulted with me thoroughly about what I wanted and what we both thought would work best.  I have thick wavy/curly/frizzy hair and wanted to try embracing my natural texture more, and leave heat styling behind.  What I ended up with was both what I wanted and better than I thought it would be.  Fatema pays attention to detail and its clear that she enjoys what she does and wants clients to be happy when they leave.  I liked my cut so much that I went back to Fatema again.  I received many compliments after both cuts, even from strangers who stopped me on the street!  Fatema has also been very helpful with advice about hair care products to help keep my hair healthy and minimize frizz.

HAIR REPUBLIC | OTTAWA SALONS,"New Edit: Fatema is hands down the best in town at this time. She gave new life to my hair by resetting my expectations keeping my best interests in mind. Will keep returning. Even after 7 years of being with them, they are keeping up the same level of standards or even better. Way to go HR! Edit: I originally wrote the review 4 years ago. Fast forward to 2021, after so many lockdowns, I booked a balayage from another reputed salon (due to the long waitlist here) in the city only to end up with frizzy, cotton candy, over processed and highly bleached hair that put me to misery. I booked a Keratin treatment and blowdry with Hair Republic to fix the damage a little bit.. and Stylist Zach is nothing short of a magician. He quickly understood my issues, reassured me that my hair is salvageable and gave me the best possible hair treatment almost returning my hair to its former glory. Its Consultants like Zach that makes Hair Republic my go-to salon in the city. And I am never making the mistake of going anywhere else again. I had my best hair cut/balayage treatment with New Talent Stylist Laura Kardos! She was excellent in understanding me, setting my expectations and delivering the results as discussed, on time, with my complete satisfaction. She also has great personality that kept the 3 hours going in a relaxed, friendly atmosphere. The receptionist Alice Kapune is warm to talk to, works brilliantly with our availability to accommodate needs. Overall, a giant positive experience. Laura will be my go-to hair stylist in Ottawa! I highly recommend her to anyone seeking a professional treatment for their hair.",5,16:06.5

HAIR REPUBLIC | OTTAWA SALONS,"I had an appointment with Ying last week.  I asked her for an easy-care cut (that I could air dry), that hid my receding hairline and didnt let hair get in my eyes.  I showed her some pictures but she gently told me that they would not be easy care with my hair texture.  My hair has changed a lot in the last 3 years so I couldnt tell what would work, but Ying could.  (This is in contrast with other stylists over the last couple of years who left me with wings once I let my hair air dry).  We discussed some options and she gave me exactly what I didnt know that I needed.  It looks great and is easy to look after.  Ying is not only a really great hair stylists but a genuinely nice person.  Thanks.",5,16:08.1
HAIR REPUBLIC | OTTAWA SALONS,I got a horrible haircut at this place. I specifically asked for someone who has experience with curly hair and my hair still ended up looking like a staircase. I wanted a layered curly haircut and the cut was so bad that I cant even let my hair down anymore. I have to tie it all times or have to use million pins to set my hair. The hairdresser also didnt know how to style curly hair after the cut. She barely used any water while applying the hair products and my hair became super frizzy. They ended up charging  me 100$ for this atrocious haircut. They only good thing about my experience was the hairdresser who was very kind and polite. I dont recommend this place for any of my curly girlies.,1,16:08.1

Harmony Hair Design,I have waist long hair and my comb out was used with a regular black com. There was no leave in conditioner used. I am a senior so my hair might be more dry. There was some unnecessary pulling causing my sides are now partial bangs. I did purchase leave in conditioner. I didnt have this experience with the hairdresser at Carlingwood as the woman used a brush and was careful. I now have a shredded length. Its disappointing since I had 5 cut the end of February to have a clean even look. I am having to wear a hair band now. Most of my experiences at this business over 4 years has been positive. I would appreciate if they would speak English in front of me when I am one of two clients in the store.,1,16:08.7
Harmony Hair Design,"I recently had the pleasure of visiting the local hair salon run by Nabila and Joe, and I must say, it was an exceptional experience. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted warmly by the staff who treated me like family. Nabila and Joe went above and beyond to ensure my comfort, especially considering I was a first-time customer. They took the time to understand exactly what I wanted and offered expert advice along the way. Their attention to detail and passion for their craft truly shone through in the final result. Whats more, the prices at the salon are quite reasonable, especially considering the level of service provided. Its evident that they prioritize customer satisfaction above all else. Overall, I cant recommend Nabila and Joes salon highly enough. If youre looking for a place where youll be treated like family and walk out feeling fabulous, this is it. Ill definitely be returning, and I encourage anyone in search of a lovely salon experience to give them a visit.",5,16:08.7

Fernandino,Love this place.,5,16:17.0
Fernandino,"Absolutely the worst experience I have ever had at a hair salon. The man who runs this place is on an ego trip, and if they screw up your hair (melted mine off with bleach) they still expect you to pay and will not refund you. Do not go here if you want to leave with your hair intact. I would give 0 stars if I could.",1,16:17.0
Fernandino,"The previous reviews are exactly on point --Melissa absolutely is the queen of blonde :D But what I would like to add that she is also the queen of alternative/nonconformative hairstyles. My hair is medium brown, fine, fragile, and brittle--and yet with Mel, we are continously able to keep it silver/white and healthy. I have also never developed such a bond with my stylist as I have with Mel. Shes just lovely. If youre looking for a stylist that actually listens to your needs and cares about what you want as a client, I honestly cant recommend her enough.",5,16:17.0
Fernandino,I went in looking for a cut my hair had been burnt the color was from a box. I needed a hair miracle. Just what I got. Melissa was pleasant from the start she gave me budget friendly options. I left feeling amazing with a refreshing cut and fantastic color that looks natural.

They set me up with an senior barber(citizen). I don t wanna sound rude or arrogant. And There is no doubt that he might have more experience than anyone else. But when he started cutting my hair he was shaking with his scissor and comb operation. I just wanted to even out my hair. But ended up leaving with uneven edges of hair on my head. The person who cut my hair, I want to tell you sir, it s not your fault that you have to work at this old age. But it is the systemic fault that created this situation.",1,16:18.8

WORST HAIRCUT for both my 2 a d 5 year old sons. Never come here . No respect or enthusiasm towards me and my toddler. She kept cutting my toddlers hair and layering in the worst way . I just wanted her to trim it.. she RUINED his hair. Need it to grow to get it fixed. My both sons had bad birthday pictures. Had a feeling I was unwanted by the barbers.  Reception was nice.

Hair Today Dye Tomorrow,"Amy (@mulletmamii) has cut my hair twice now and shes seriously incredible. I dont get my hair cut very often.. Im very selective about who can work on my look. Theres something magic about her ability to work with you to collaboratively envision, cut out the extra, get down to whats important... and Amy nails it. Shes crafted the best haircuts Ive ever had, and I leave feeling so good. I feel seen and witnessed in her chair and I find she really empowers her clients. I moved out of Ottawa over a year ago and recently came back for a visit and went straight to her. Im so happy to feel like myself again and have my outgrown hair taken care of. I highly recommend.

Hair Today Dye Tomorrow,"When I got my hair done at this salon I felt that the stylist (Amy) did not want me there. Her customer manner made me feel uncomfortable and she had a too cool attitude making conversation challenging. I specifically asked her not to put too many products in my hair and I came out with hair so full of product it felt like hay. My hair cut was flattering, she is clearly a skilled hairstylist.

BossArts Salon and Spa,I had a very disappointing experience with this salon last weekend. See attached picture where the nail length is not even across fingers.

BossArts Salon and Spa,"My experience: I was suggested this stylist cuz apparently she has more experience with curly/ wavy hair but she didnt follow any techniques for my hair either its detangling or styling I just got treated like straight hair. My purple color didnt stick in the first wash so I got shampooed twice again by another person cuz the first stylist has another appointment. she used too much heat and detangled my hair harshly so that she can be done with me quickly and go for her next appointment. Excessive shampooing, pulling and heat made my scalp dry and gave me a headache. On the other hand I am kinda satisfied with my results but the experience was not good. Personally I wouldnt visit again I prefer a stylish who have understanding of wavy hair type and take special care. I expected a soothing experience instead I waited for it to get over so I can relax",3,16:23.9

I have thick curly hair that many in the past have struggled with but Taras skills she made everything look and feel effortless! Shes so kind and really listens making sure to take care of you and your hair needs. When she washes your hair you practically drift off to sleep.

BossArts Salon and Spa,Amy is absolutely amazing! I haven t been to a salon in 5 years & so I was a bit nervous at first. I came in for a women s cut but had little ideas of how I wanted the style to be. Amy had beautiful suggestions since I had very long & straight hair. She made sure to check up on me through every step of the way as well as explaining what she was about to do with my hair. It was never a dull moment with Amy because she truly kept me entertained. The salon was also a very friendly place with great customer service. I was extremely satisfied with Amy s services. I could tell how much she loves what she does!

She is also not precious about promoting Boss Arts  brand partner (Aveda), and will provide alternative product solutions based on your budget.

BossArts Salon and Spa,"Don t ever come here if you have curly hair that people would say is  ethnic  by Ottawa s standards. I asked for a curly specialist but was given someone who didn t know how to cut curly hair at all. To make it worse, while he s cutting my hair he says  curly girls are crazy, they re all temper mental about their hair . He then brushed all of my curls out and cut a huge chunk out before checking with me. When I asked to see the length he told me that I was freaking him out and made me feel bad for wanting to see my own hair. He blunt cut all around my head. He didn t add water during the process to check what my curls would even look like after. I left with a frizzy poof on my head and cried in the car. It took me 2 years of growing my hair out. If you don t know how to cut curly hair, don t say that you can. Educate yourself and don t make clients feel bad for what type of hair they have. I d rather you refuse to cut my hair than ruin it.",1,16:26.5
BossArts Salon and Spa,"I had my hair done by Rajaa and it was my first time getting my hair coloured. She did a great job and provided with my with exactly what I wanted. She asked if she could make minor changes based on the image I showed for my hair, to make it suit me more (I had also asked for her opinion on if she believed the inspiration image I showed would suit me). She did a great job on my hair colour and cut. The staff was also very kind and helpful. I definitely recommend this salon!",5,16:26.5

BossArts Salon and Spa,"Im editing my review from a year ago. I have been a loyal customer for many, many years but have been so disappointed with my last experience that I think it is time for me to move on to a new salon for my hair. Both when I scheduled the appointment and in-person I said I wanted a color correction/something to blend my grown out balayage better with my natural color that would be low maintenance as I have a hard time finding the time and getting downtown to keep up with coloring. Balayage can be good for 6 months so I was open to that again (if it could be closer to my natural color) or other options. I was told I was given a demi permanent color that would match my natural color and slowly fade away over time. My 2 issues is that at the end of the appointment that I was told that this was a toner that will fade in a month and cost $100. Why would I be given something that would only last a month when I specified I wanted something long term? My second issue is that it did not match my natural hair color at all (which I guess it is good it will fade out in only a month!). At the salon it didnt look too dark and I figured it was just because any darkness was due to the old balayage being covered but as I got home I realize how stupid it looks. My hair is dark brown and my eyebrows are blonde....we had family photos taken the other day and my hair almost looks black in them. Really shouldnt have gone to the appointment at all. It was a waste of money and time, it took alot of planning and time to organize getting downtown for the appointment and I regret it. I will spend the next week washing my hair to try and get this out before starting over at another salon.",2,16:26.5
BossArts Salon and Spa,"AMY WAS AMAZING! I cannot give her enough praises. A complete gem to talk to. I left extremely happy! She made me feel beyond comfortable, was knowledgeable, reassuring and took my  hair dresser trauma  and made this experience amazing. For any curly needs I would highly suggest visiting Amy! 5 stars Services: Shampoo & conditioning , Blowouts",5,16:26.5
BossArts Salon and Spa,Nobody has really done layered haircut I wanted having tried 2 hairdressers already. Not really pleased with lots of uneven cuts. Might try more experienced stylist.,3,16:26.5
BossArts Salon and Spa,I was in Ottawa visiting and happened to walk in for a blow dry.  I was scheduled with Rajaa and I was very pleased with the results.  I ended up going three times during my short stay.  I will definitely come back!,5,16:26.5
ElectroSquid Hair Studio,The absolute best place to get your hair coloured in Ottawa! Whatever you can imagine they can do.,5,16:27.1
ElectroSquid Hair Studio,"I clearly explained what I wanted to Melissa in the initial call and before the haircut.  I only wanted to have a two-inch trim and shaping of the back, with a scissor cut only.  I was sent Jamie for the haircut, and I repeated what I wanted with him before they started, and during the haircut.  They insisted that 2 inches trim was not enough, and I agreed to 4 inches taken off.  I was shocked to discover that my hair was actually cut 8 to 12 inches, and whole areas were cut and texturized.   They used a razor and thinner, when I only asked for scissors to be used, and there are large gaps or holes in my hair now.  My hairline in the back is 2-3 inches higher than before, again without my consent. I was very upset after my haircut, and when I very politely brought this to Melissa and Jamie (the specific stylist), I was not even offered an apology, explanation, or a refund. Moreover, Jamie claimed that he did everything I asked and denied any mistakes or wrongdoing of any kind.  Overall, the haircut and the service were very poor, and the response was hurtful, unprofessional, and lacking in empathy. I was then not only completely invalidated, but also gaslit about what happened. Im writing this review not as retaliation, but to inform future customers to be aware of what actually happened to me. I have been grieving the loss of so much hair, and recovering from this violating experience.",1,16:27.1
ElectroSquid Hair Studio,"Hands down one of the best experiences I ve had in a salon. It honestly felt like I was visiting a friend- it is a very welcoming, comfy and safe environment. I am so happy with my hair. Will 100% come back. Thank you:)",5,16:27.1

ElectroSquid Hair Studio,,5,16:27.7
ElectroSquid Hair Studio,"In the lovely neighbourhood of Hintonburg, Electrosquid fits right in. I chose to go to this studio recently because I remember Melissa cutting my hair previously at a different salon, and was excited to hear that she had moved to her own (co-owned) studio. As a queer person with curly hair and sensory issues, this salon is just right. The smaller size (2 stylists) means that appointments are quieter, and much more comfortable atmosphere for me. The place is easy to find with the bright colours on the exterior, and easy to commute to. The decor in the shop is unique and wonderful, and Melissa was so friendly. For such a big city, it can be hard to find people who know how to cut curly hair well. I went in without any photo references since it can be hard to find reference haircuts for short hair with my curl type, but Melissa was so patient and flexible. I will definitely be going back for regular haircuts here with Melissa.",5,16:27.7
ElectroSquid Hair Studio,My favourite hair studio!!! Melissa is honestly a superhuman who can do miracles with hair. She also just  gets it  when you tell her what you want.

I have thick, curly difficult hair and Sonia understood from the start how to cut it to suit my face. I never feel pressured to do things with my hair that arent my kind of thing - Sonia gets it.

Even the sink was clogged with hair strands of previous customers! Very unhygienic. Never going back to that place again.",1,16:34.8

Syn Sue Salon,"Edit: I gave an honest review about Sue over processing my hair during a relaxer retouch because she booked multiple clients within same time slot and failed to attend to washing off the chemical on time. Sue has called me out my post on her instagram for her loyal customers to judge. I found this salon on the website. And decided to go f there for a relaxer touch up. She seemed to have overbooked her day and had multiple clients lined up. In the heat of it all, multitasking between multiple clients, she applied relaxer to my thriving hair and got going with another client even when I was calling her attention that she was leaving the relaxer on for too long. The damage has been done. My hair got over processed and I had to cut it all off because I just couldn t live with the aftermath. It too me 5yrs to grow that hair. Never again!",1,16:47.7
Syn Sue Salon,"Let me tell ya about Suzette, shes professional! She slayed my silk press, giving me hair thats poppin with bounce, silkiness, and shine. Shes super cool and real.

Syn Sue Salon,"Suzette is extremely talented, professional, knowledgeable and kind.. she s the best hair stylist I have used.. and I ve been to many over the years. She straightened my natural hair a few times and it always turned out lovely. Most recently, I decided to get a weave for the first time, and it looks so beautiful!!!  I was nervous because I never had a weave before, but Suzette s guidance quickly alleviated that. Prior to my appointment, she was very responsive to my queries online, and shared multiple photos of different styles with various price points to meet my needs. She even took the time to call me to explain the different options. She s honest, reliable and uses high quality products. I highly recommend her.. if you re looking for a weave (or any hair style) in Ottawa, call Suzette.",5,16:48.3

Syn Sue Salon,"Syn Sue is amazing! I got a silk press done, I actually didnt know she did silk press and I had been looking for someone who would help me with a silk press but would also keep in mind that I want my hair to remain healthy. Syn Sue was very helpful with all this. She educated me on the fact that although I am getting a silk press, my hair will not go though any damages because of the treatment process she applied before proceeding with the silk press. Thank you Syn Sue, I absolutely love my hair and cant wait for out next appointment :)",5,16:48.3
Syn Sue Salon,"Sue has magic hands. I came to her with severely damaged under-processed relaxed hair that was breaking. I had been natural all my life and decided during the pandemic to relax my hair. Boy, was that a big mistake on my part. Within one visit, my hair was bouncy, flowed and it did not break each time I ran my fingers through my hair. I was shocked on how great my hair looked. I will never let anyone touch my hair except for Sue after such a great experience. My hair feels and looks very healthy and I will continue seeing her for deep treatments and to wash, condition and straighten my hair. I am very happy with her level of service and professionalism she provides. She now has a long lasting customer. I have referred other friends to her as I was amazed on how she was able to turn around the condition of my hair very quickly. I am a very satisfied and happy client. Thanks SUE!

Syn Sue Salon,"Ladies, no need to search for another option, Suzette is it. I was in a town for a few weeks and I wasnt going to be able to head home before my next trip and by the grace of google I found Suzette. I reached out and she was able to see me on a Saturday which was perfect. Syn Sue Salon is immaculate, I felt immediately at home. Suzette does everything at the salon which means that you will be in her capable hands for the entire service. Not only did my wash and style come out perfectly but she was able to get to the root of a recent issue Ive been having and suggested what I can do to improve the situation. Next time Im in Ottawa I will definitely be back.",5,16:49.5
Syn Sue Salon,"Beautiful salon with professional and friendly service. Hair treated, cut and styled exactly how I wanted.",5,16:49.5
Syn Sue Salon,"Suzette doesnt want to work with your natural long hair, if its not a loose curl and you arent going to straighten the hair or put a weave in it or wear one of her wigs. She was rude and very forgetful throughout all the interactions I had with her; Instagram, phone, in person and her Facebook business page. She just reaffirmed why I wont wear weave with all of her fake niceness (directing me to a salon that has people on drugs) and her self-hate. I dont want to end up like that where I hate myself enough to be rude to natural haired women that have a natural curl pattern that is coily and tighter.",1,16:49.5
Syn Sue Salon,,5,16:50.2
Syn Sue Salon,I had lost faith in my hair when I decided to book an appointment at the Salon. Relaxing my hair always comes with burns and poor results. She was super professional and friendly at the same time. Most importantly she knows her stuff. My hair looked stunning after my session with her: soft and bouncy and healthy. I couldnt believe my eyes. I was smiling constantly  . Thank you Sue!,5,16:50.2
Syn Sue Salon,So I called this salon to book an appointment many times and nobody ever answered the phone I left 2 messages and still nobody returned my call so I deff will not be making anymore effort to book an appointment at this salon such a shame I understand you can get busy but it takes two min to check ur voicemail and return a call,2,16:50.2

Syn Sue Salon,"I first started going to the salon 7 years ago. I had been on the hunt for a new hairstylist since I moved here. Upon reading fantastic reviews about the salon, I decided to give it a shot, and couldnt have made a better decision. Suzette is lovely, and extremely skilled at what she does. Im the type of person who is very shy at first, but she made me feel very comfortable and time flew by while I was sitting in her chair. The salon itself is of good size, always clean -- very relaxing atmosphere. Synsue is a true gem Im glad to have discovered. I strongly recommend it!",5,16:50.2

Bollywood Salon,"I went there to get my eyebrows threading done for the first time and must say that I was extremely disappointed. The lady had no idea what she was doing, she messed up my eyebrows and they did not look groomed at all. It was a horrible experience and sheer waste of money. Never going back there!",1,16:50.8
Bollywood Salon,"Id steer clear of this spot. The communication is off, and it feels l rude. Plus, the prices keep changing like the weather. Maybe some customer communication classes could help smooth things out on her part.",1,16:50.8
Bollywood Salon,"I came here previously for eyebrow threading a month ago ast time, I was charged $14.56, which was fine. However, this time, after a month, I was charged $23.56 for the same service. The esthetician claimed it was because she only did the middle of my eyebrows last time, which isnt true because she cleaned my entire eyebrows just in 5 minutes. It seems she wanted to overcharge me this time. I wont be returning. Overcharging people without justification is not acceptable.Also the lady  messed up my eyebrows in less than 5 minutes.",1,16:50.8

Bollywood Salon,Thank you for the great henna allergy-free hair color.. I am very pleased that I found this place. I have a very large number of allergies and henna is the only hair color which  does not trigger my skin allergies. I have been coming here for about three years.  One of the co-owners figured out how to do henna in a one-coat application which I much appreciate. Henna application does take longer than a chemical hair color and that is normal.  The other co-owner does great haircuts. Highly recommended for people with allergies  who may have a hard time elsewhere.,5,16:52.0

When I got there, someone was already seated and there were already about 4 different women at the salon waiting next. She didnt seat me until approaching 2PM. I decided to be patient because I didnt have anything scheduled that day. As soon as I got in the seat, Alem was immediately rushing my hair. I came to get almost balyage-like styled highlights and instead she just did regular bleached highlights that didnt compliment my skin tone at all and were extremely spaced out. After she washed out the bleach, she literally just slapped on leave in conditioner. No toning, treatment, nothing of the sort. It was my first professional hair dying experience so I didnt know what to expect, but after consulting with other stylists this experience was truly disrespectful. I was in such a state of shock by what happened and there were so many customers (I can tell they were her regulars) who were complimenting the work, I was too embarrassed to speak about how I really felt. I didnt want to write this review because I want to support my fellow black businesses and not tear anyone down, but I came to this salon with the best intentions. Im a student and I had wanted to treat myself, I spent my hard earned money on an experience where my feelings and time were just completely disregarded. Please do not pick favourites and feel as though you HAVE to serve your regulars who show up unannounced because you feel an obligation, over customers who took time out of their schedule to come and see you. I write this with no ill intent, I really want you to succeed in hopes you dont repeat this experience again. Thank you. Service:",2,16:55.8

Unique Beauty Spa,Ive been going here for almost 20 years and will keep going as long as its open.,5,16:55.8
Unique Beauty Spa,"I have been getting  a lot of complaints about my hair since day one I meet you Alem, you are doing a great job god bless your amazing hands. My hair looks and feels fantastic and am so grateful to be in you capable hands. Please keep this amazing work, I definitely recommend this place to everyone.....",5,16:55.8
Unique Beauty Spa,My sister loves this place! Shes used Alem for everything from her prom to her wedding. Shes brought my niece there too. Its not easy to make both children and adults satisfied but Alem is a gentle soul with blessed hairstyling hands and does both.,5,16:55.8
Unique Beauty Spa,"I just moved to Gatineau which is about 20 minutes from Unique Beauty Spa in Ottawa and I have been blessed to discover this place! I really needed to find a great salon with professional hairstylist to care for my hair and keep it healthy. This place is amazing! The hairstylist is so caring, professional, great quality of service, very clean. You get what you pay for and more! I recommend this place to anyone who wants healthy hair. While I was there I saw her dying a customers hair...wow wow that was so beautifully done!",5,16:55.8
Unique Beauty Spa,"Thank God she is open again after COVID! I was in need of hair help. Unique beauty spa works with all hair types and textures. They offer a full range of services as well: relaxer, texturizer and hair treatment. Also, extension and A-Mazing colour such as ombre.  I ll attach some pics from clients on her wall. I did not realize she did all this. Parking is available and free - just ask or you can take a bus (#85/#11) here drops you right in front. Pay with all forms of payment. Such a convenient location! Minutes from Gatineau and Hull and close to downtown, Chinatown and Little Italy. Come and get your hair done and go eat dinner after to show it off in little Italy.",5,16:55.8
Unique Beauty Spa,"Hidden gem. This is the only place I trust with my hair ever since I became natural. It is gentle I see my hair flourishing and not breaking or dry!!! be sure to get the treatment And be prepared to spend a longer than an hour because the natural hair takes a longer and GENTLER approach in order to stay healthy! If you want fast and quick with no worries about long term hair health- go to any other hair salon. If your hair is permed etc and easier you have other options but if you want overall healthy longer hair- you will not be disappointed. Specialized in mixed kids from what I see. Also does great color for dark hair. Many loyal clients over the 10 years I have been coming here and I don t think it s because of coincidence. Again, be prepared to stay longer than a regular visit but the price is still well worth it.",5,16:56.3

Starz Salon Spa,AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This place fools you with a low price tag to get you in the door and then adds unnecessary steps and products to charge much much more.

Texture Hair Boutique,"**Update** The salon never reached out to me to make this right or offer to fix the haircut. Would absolutely never go there again and wouldn t recommend to anyone. Went for a very straightforward hair cut here last week and 10/10 would NOT recommend. My hair is very long and I went to have it cut to collarbone length and donated. Sara, the stylist put my hair in pony tails that were below collarbone length because she said several times she wanted to make sure she didn t cut too short. Fast forward 30 minutes and I have a full on Mom Bob. My hair is a solid 3 inches shorter than I asked for, doesn t even touch my shoulders  oh, and this horrible Bob is incredibly CROOKED and completely different lengths on each side. Half way through the hair cut I said  I m worried you re giving me a Bob here  and my stylist said  oh no, no it s not a Bob, don t worry.  My reaction when the whole cut was done was that I have never felt so much like a mom  not a compliment. A very straightforward and very easy haircut that was done so badly/ not even a little what I asked for and then cost $97.",1,17:02.6

Texture Hair Boutique,Colourist Britt was absolutely amazing. She corrected a very horrible colour job I had done at another salon. Got me in very quickly and was spot on with what I was asking for. She really did an impressive job. Very sweet and personable but also very professional. I run a rescue for orphan kittens and puppies so I had 2 week old kittens that had to come to my appointment which they were very understanding.

My family decide to go there to get my little sister a quick cut that usually takes max 20 minutes. It was 4:15, there was no one in at the time and several workers just standing there talking. when my dad asked them if they could do my sisters hair nicely. the women then said no sorry we are closing soon. I checked and it was 4:24 and they were just standing there saying they didnt have the time when they had 1 good employee cleaning the floor while they were standing there. Im assuming that they were extremely lazy and just wanted to finish the other 35 minutes just to get payed and leave. They dont care about the customers they care about the MONEY!!!",1,17:16.8

Voila Coiffure & Spa Inc,"I was a long-time customer of the owner of Voila Coiffure & Mini Spa when I had a disappointing and distressing experience during one of my visits. Without my knowledge or consent, she gave me an inappropriate and unprofessional haircut, etching an offensive design on the back of my head that I only noticed after I got home and looked in the mirror. What made the situation even more upsetting was that I had been confiding in her about a personal matter during this visit. I ultimately attended an important family event with this unfortunate haircut, feeling embarrassed and betrayed by someone I had trusted for years. Given my experience, I urge others to think twice before trusting the owner with their hair, as her actions have shown a lack of integrity and professionalism.",1,17:17.2

We chatted about what I wanted done, and she offered her expertise to help me narrow down my options, which was exactly what I wanted!!!! We ended up deciding to go with a natural-looking balayage and a cut just past my shoulder. Balayage is a tricky technique, and she absolutely nailed it. The progression is so smooth, and the colour is absolutely perfect. She is so passionate about what she does, and you can tell in the care she puts into her work. She was thrilled to help me figure out what my ideal hairstyle was, and bring it to fruition. I can not speak highly enough of her. She is open to what you want, but she is honest will tell you if its not the best option for your hair or lifestyle which is so incredible. She took my cut into her own hands, as I had thought I wanted a short cut. She told me that it would be best if it was a bit longer, and then went to work. I could not be more thrilled with the outcome. I have always wanted balayage hair, so there was a good amount of pressure on this cut&colour. But she surpassed all my expectations!!!! I spent the whole day floating on air - I feel so beautiful. Thank you Lean.

Fernando Cellini Hair Salon,"Sorry to leave this review. Went on April 19th with high hope considering all the good reviews, and especially because I ve been looking for good hair stylist. Before Dominic started hair cut I asked him, hope I m not gonna be disappointed, and he answered of course not. So, I went home and checked in the mirror to see how it was cut in the back and sides it was nothing like that I wanted. Even though I showed him a photo of the hair cut it was not even similar. I look like a Cherokee. Very disappointed, upset and frustrated. Spent $140 +tax. Regret to cut my hair in that hair salon. Hopefully they will refund??? Thank you for the worst hair cut.

Fernando Cellini Hair Salon,"I am sorry to leave this review. I went there with very high hopes considering all the good reviews and especially because I have been looking for a good hair stylist for a very long time since I moved to Ottawa. I had my hair cut by Dom. At the salon, after he styled it, it looked more or less, but I only cared about having a well done haircut. However, home, after I washed my hair and I checked it in the mirror to see how it was cut in the back and sides,  it was nothing like the haircuts that I had showed him. I am very disappointed, upset and frustrated right now. These were the worst spent 180 dollars, and the worst haircut done by a professional.",1,17:27.1

Fernando Cellini Hair Salon,"Burned my healthy long hair so badly there are short broken hairs frizzing out from the crown to the tip past my shoulders (not flyaways or dryness. My hair is broken off throughout the length of my hair)- TOTALLY destroyed my soft healthy hair into a cracked, brittle, broken mess. It took four years for me to grow it out and now Im back to square one. I have to wear a pony tail every day. Emails and phone calls to owner not returned. I did get a partial refund of $197 from my $415 bill, but then spent over $200 in rescue remedies - none of which have helped. Now, I have frizzy yellow-orange hair instead of the beautiful silky blonde that I started with. I hope this review saves someone from going through similar disappointment.",1,17:27.7

Studio B,Went for a cut and color as I feel that Aran is talented and has a unique eye as a stylist. The rating is low as I realize now that the hospitality and chats with me were forced and that Aran and her receptionist made passive-aggressive comments directed at me personally. How entertaining. Felt so uncomfortable and could not wait to leave. Wont return or recommend. Many other salons offering professionalism.,2,17:32.1

The girl bleached and stripped the color out of my hair then gave it an ashy brown to cover up the rest of the red. For those of you who dont know color, bleaching and stripping color is essentially the same thing, so the lady over procceced my already thin, fine hair.

Studio B,"I have been coming here for years and am never disappointed by Arran s service. I referred a friend to Arran and she stated it was the best cut and colour she has had in her life. Recently Arran saved my daughter s hair after a stylist at Rinaldo s (see that review) left her with a head full of bright peach and pink hair with claims that she could do nothing to fix it. Arran knew exactly what had been done wrong and how to fix it. She transformed the crayon concoction back to her natural blonde. I am posting the after. The before peach/pink disaster pic is posted in my Rinaldo s review. If you want a professional book with Arran. And by the way, I didn t have to sit and supervise the service as was suggested by Rinaldo s management as a solution to making sure this doesn t happen again. A professional doesn t need supervision.",5,17:32.7
Studio B,"I truly had the most TERRIBLE experience at this hair salon & I m not a super picky person. Usually I get my hair fully dyed & styled, but I just wanted a quick cut & style so I decided to try this salon because it looked cute & artsy. It was the most AWFUL vibe. The lady who I guess owns it?! Arran or something did my hair & seemed extremely on edge, to the point it made me anxious & uncomfortable. She was pulling at my hair & quite rough when was she cutting it. I didn t like the way she straightened it because she made it look very flat & when I asked if she could make it more voluminous & shiny she got mad at me & freaked out saying I was 15 minutes late & she was pressed for time, even though I had called ahead of time saying I was stuck in traffic. Extremely unprofessional and I left paying way more than I should have for that terrible experience... ($93 for a simple cut & style that honestly looks like I could have done it myself at home). I felt very anxious and uncomfortable throughout the whole experience & I will absolutely never set foot in there again...",1,17:32.7

They dont try to up sell you products or services - latest techniques, funky or not and prices are reasonable.  Aaron was my stylist twice but the other stylists are great from what Ive seen walk out of the salon.  Cody is adorable & gives a great scalp massage.",5,17:33.2

Studio B,"Love love love Studio B! Went for a bangs trim awhile back and Arran rocked it, so I made another appointment for a cut. Wow, she made my hair look amazing and with little to no direction! I only told her I didnt want short-short and that I need a low maintenance style. Did she ever deliver. I dont find the price too bad for Ottawa. It was about $20 more than I used to pay. The salon itself is laid back, all the staff are super welcoming and friendly, and I love hanging out with the puppy! The decor is funky and fun.",5,17:33.2

Studio B,"I had a terrible experience at Studio B in December. I made my first appointment with Amber to have some pink added to the tips of my hair and to touch up my red hair dye at the roots. I was originally booked for a consult with Amber, but the salon later called back and cancelled the consultation, saying that Amber understood what I wanted and I could just come to the appointment. I brought my colour info from my previous stylist (Im from out of town and was considering Studio B as my new salon), and said that I was looking for a demi-permanent for the red, which is what I am accustomed to having. I showed the info from my previous stylist to Amber and she said that my two options were semi-permanent (which would wash out in about 4 washings), or permanent colour. I asked what the price difference was, and she told me it would be $50, so I opted for the permanent colour. The entire appointment took a little over 5 hours (I have never had hair take that long, and Ive had some pretty complicated custom colour jobs in the past). In the entire time, Amber hardly said two words to me. I made several attempts to strike up a conversation with her, but they fell flat each time. Amber went out of her way to socialize with the other stylists, the other stylists clients, and even the delivery man. I understand that not every stylist enjoys talking through an entire colour job, but I would expect that she might have tried to get to know me as I was a potential new client. When she was finally able to wash the colour out of my hair, she scrubbed parts of my hairline raw trying to get the dye off my skin. I told her that it hurt and asked her to be more gentle, which she sort of did but continued scrubbing anyways. When she brought me back to her chair she suggested that she turn me away from the mirror so she could surprise me when it was dried. I suspected that this point that she actually did it because it was a bit of a hot mess, but I went along with it anyways. When she was finished, I must say, the colour is gorgeous. What I wouldnt notice until I got home (since I wear long bangs), was that there was dye from my hairline down to my eyebrows, and all the way down the back of my neck to my shoulders! All of this aside, my biggest beef was the price. The entire job cost more than double what I was expecting to pay, based on the pricing on the website. I paid and left, because I had already spent nearly 6 hours in the salon and needed to get home. When I got home, I discovered that the place along my hairline that Amber had scrubbed raw was actually bleeding (I had scabs all along my hairline for days following the appointment), and the dye on the back of my neck took days to wash off as well, forcing me to wear my hair down for days. In an attempt to make things right, I called the salon the next day and described my experience. They had Amber call me back and authorized a free treatment to make me happy, but I insisted that a partial refund was necessary, since I had no intention of coming back. She informed me that the price we arrived at was only $50 more than what we discussed at my consultation (the one she cancelled, which therefore, never happened). She then quickly back-peddled and suggested that there had been an email consult, which there never was (I only ever communicated with the salon by phone). We agreed upon an amount that would have us meeting halfway between what I thought I was paying that day, and what I ended up paying. However, when I went in to receive my refund, the owner nickel and dimed me on it, reducing the refund to nearly half what Amber had promised on the phone. The colour job is amazing, but Amber is a talented colourist and I am sure a more affordable colour job would have also looked amazing too. Essentially, I was upsold without being told the cost (and Im not sure I ever would have been given one, since there were a lot of extra charges thrown in, like $40 for a blow dry - what salon sends you out into the winter with wet hair from a fresh dye job???). Save your $$, go elsewhere",1,17:34.4

Salon Rouge Ottawa,"This is a reply to the below reviews from Rhonda, Kristine, Noel, Adrienne, Shauna and Dianne s. This is what really happened. Your friend came in just wanting some pieces in the front, then changed her mind to getting a full balayage instead once in the Salon. She wanted to get a funky color (which is way more complicated), we did not want to say no to her because we know she came a long way to Ottawa, and we wanted to accommodate her. As a result, our stylist had to get somebody else to pick up their small children (5 and 7 years old) from their day care. Because she was so excited to get her hair done. Her hair was black long, and down to her waist, thick with no color. Her services were a Wash cut and blow-dry, full Balayage and a funky color toner, which should have been $500 but we only charged her $378 (which is a very good deal for what we had to do and for that amount of hair). She also ended up buying Kevin Murphy hair products (which is a very high-end brand), which she got in the big Litre sizes because she mentioned that where she was located there were no good hair products. Which workout to be nowhere near $800. In no shape or form did we take advantage of anyone as our prices (of services and products) are all on our website. Please before accusing any one of something, the employees of the salon including myself (as a black girl) the receptionist are all immigrants and are minorities that have had our own personal experiences. Please next time find out what really happened.",5,17:35.0
Salon Rouge Ottawa,Always such a good experience. Been coming to this place for over 4 years and they always do such a good job. Price is fair for the high quality experience you receive. Jane is now been my stylist for the past year and a bit and she is absolutely lovely. I have always got what I asked for from the team and I trust them with my hair.,5,17:35.0

Salon Rouge Ottawa,"I m still upset with the crooked cut and a colour I didn t want in the first place. I walked in with virgin hair and my expectations were high but, I was disappointed when my hair went back to its natural straightness and it s crooked and so obvious. They didn t have the colour I originally wanted and the hairdresser didn t know until checking for the product. For $800+ this shouldn t have happened.",1,17:35.6
Salon Rouge Ottawa,"How could you guys charge $800 for a balayage on virgin hair, a crooked layered cut and it wasn t even the colour that was wanted. She deserves a refund and to go elsewhere! If you re indigenous with long hair do not go here!!! How awful!!!",1,17:35.6
Salon Rouge Ottawa,"This salon takes advantage of Indigenous people because they think we get free money not thinking that is a racist remark.

Amir finished the appointment with a great cut and advice on how to maintain the health and growth of my hair. I went to Amir and his team after a very unfortunate experience at a high end downtown Ottawa salon that not only cost me hundreds, but it took almost a year for my hair to be ready for any processing.

Once my hair was bleached he said that he did not have that color that I wanted. I had to choice another different color. Second, once they finished dying my hair they did not clean my neck, forehead and ears. My skin was covered on dye. Third, the haircut was uneven. I had to go to another place so they can fix it. At the end all the services were very expensive and were not done properly. I will never go there again. Services: Shampoo & conditioning , Hair coloring",1,17:36.8

Hair Resort,"I was extremely disappointed with the style Danny gave me. I booked with him on the day of a wedding I was going to, to have a trim and get some curls and body. I feel like he rushed through it because his next appointment was there and waiting and staring at us the entire time. He never asked me where my hair parts naturally and instead made a giant rats nest out of my roots. The wand he used wasnt hot at all and the curls fell straight within half an hour. I had to re-do everything in my hotel room. Terrible that I spent around $80 on that. The two friends I was with had beautiful styles from Taylor and Brittany and they made sure my friends actually liked the end result before dismissing them. It honestly seemed like he just wanted to get me over with and Im fairly certain he wasnt even pleased with his own work. So disappointing!",2,17:51.1
