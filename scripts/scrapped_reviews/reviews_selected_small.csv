Curly Hair Designs,"We just had the most wonderful experience at Curly Hair Designs. My daughter had an appointment today with the marvellous owner, Paula, and her fantastic apprentice, Ayesha.  I cannot express how thrilled we are with the results! We were shown such kindness and care and it truly made our day. The transformation of my daughter s curls is amazing, but it s the transformation in my daughter s confidence that I m most excited about. She LOVES her hair and feels so beautiful and it made me tear up to see her feeling so powerful and self-assured.  Paula really took the time to show us both how to help my daughter s curls get and stay hydrated and healthy. I ve struggled for years with a million different products and I finally feel like I have a system and tools to help my daughter, and I m just so grateful!. My only wish is that I had found Paula and Curly Hair Designs sooner. Thank you Paula and Ayesha for being so patient and for taking such care with my daughter and I.",5,12:42.4
Curly Hair Designs,"I truly can t recommend this business enough. The work that Paula does in education and hair care during your appointment is incredible.

Curly Hair Designs,"Rhea was fantastic! Having not been to a hair stylist for quite awhile, I did lots of research to determine where I wanted to go and which stylist I wanted to see. I was not disappointed at all. Rhea answered all my questions, told me everything she was doing and all the products and techniques she was using so I could try to replicate the results myself at home. Its not quite been a week so well see how that goes. I love my new look (she gave me a great cut, and replicated the style I had in mind) and the fact that Im not tying up my hair or hiding it away. I feel inspired to continue going with my natural curls.",5,12:42.4

Curly Hair Designs,"Rhea is just incredible. I cant say enough good things about my experience at CHD. Ive been getting my hair cut here for years and I have to echo other reviews raving about the knowledge and care that goes into every visit. My hair has never looked better, curlier, or healthier. I now understand my curls!! But the cherry on top is the styling that Rhea did for my wedding last weekend. She took so much care in setting each curl perfectly, and was even ahead of schedule! People could not stop complimenting my natural curls! And they held through a downpour of rain, photos, dancing, and even overnight. I woke up the next morning still looking perfect.

Curly Hair Designs,"AMAZING first visit ! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! I had booked a consultation for the wrong service but Rhea saved the day. She took the time to know my hair history, products being used ,treatments that have been done, wants & desires for moving forward with my hair as well. When I left I was more knowledgeable on product ingredients, managing my hair type & purchased some of their sold in store products. When I tell you I was instantly sold on this being my home salon after meeting the phenomenal stylist ,once I used their recommended hair products I have officially thrown out every other product I used to use. My beautiful curls are coming back stronger, healthier than ever & are extremely moisturized",5,12:43.5

Curly Hair Designs,"Hello! I found a salon that I can trust will take utmost care of their customers. Patricia is a true professional curly hair stylist. She made my experience memorable and long lasting because I absolutely love my cut. She made my experience fun, exciting and educational. She taught me how to maintain a style, as well as switch it up. She knew how to frame a cut for my face shape and personality. I went from very long to over the shoulder and asked myself:  Why haven t I been coming to this salon all this time?!  If you re looking for a salon to take quality care of your curly locks, I wouldn t recommend any other place! I look forward to our next visit, Patricia! Many, many thanks!
