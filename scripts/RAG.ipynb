I cannot express how thrilled we are with the results! We were shown such kindness and care and it truly made our day. The transformation of my daughter s curls is amazing, but it s the transformation in my daughter s confidence that I m most excited about. She LOVES her hair and feels so beautiful and it made me tear up to see her feeling so powerful and self-assured.  Paula really took the time to show us both how to help my daughter s curls get and stay hydrated and healthy. I ve struggled for years with a million different products and I finally feel like I have a system and tools to help my daughter, and I m just so grateful!. My only wish is that I had found Paula and Curly Hair Designs sooner. Thank you Paula and Ayesha for being so patient and for taking such care with my daughter and I.',\n",
